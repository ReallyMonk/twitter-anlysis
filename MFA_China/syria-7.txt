2021-05-14  The #US waged wars and military operations in Iraq, #Libya, #Syria, #Afghanistan and other countries in the name of ‚Äúfighting terrorism‚Äù, taking the lives of over a million #Muslims and displacing tens of millions. Where is the US concern for human rights?
2021-05-11  The #US killed #Muslims more than any other country in the world. As it waged wars and carried out military operations in the name of "counterterrorism" in 80-plus countries, leading to 800,000+ deaths and tens of millions displaced in #Afghanistan, #Iraq and #Syria.  https://t.co/Ts9uEIDjD8

2021-03-30  Remember what the #US &amp; some of its allies did to #Iraq, #Syria &amp; #Libya? Waged wars based on "evidence" which later proved to be false. The price is death &amp; displacement of millions of #Muslims. Justice may be late, but will prevail in the end.  https://t.co/aWdWEDAqSg
2021-03-26  #China supports #MiddleEast countries in exploring their ouw paths of develpoment. It supports regional countries and their peoples in playing a major role in pursuing political settlement of such hotspot issues as #Syria, #Yemen and #Libya.
2021-03-23  The #US and #UK used some test tube of washing powder and a staged video as evidence to launch wars against sovereign countries such as #Iraq and #Syria, leaving numerous death and displacement. Shouldn't they be sanctioned?
