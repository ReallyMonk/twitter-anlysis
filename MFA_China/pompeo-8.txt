2021-01-20  Neglecting facts but sowing lies reveals #Pompeo's true intent to interfere in China's internal affairs, undermine China's stability&amp;contain China's development. Justice may be late, but it will catch up. Pompeo&amp;his lies will find a comfortable place in the dustbin of history.  https://t.co/srg8Rlorzf
2021-01-20  #Pompeo's lies are an affront to the 1.4 billion Chinese people including 25 million #Xinjiang residents &amp; to the intelligence of the American people and the international community. He has betrayed &amp; challenged the basic moral standard &amp; human conscience.
2021-01-20  "China committing genocide &amp; crimes against humanity in #Xinjiang" only exists in #Pompeo's ugly political conspiracies. It has never happened and will never happen in our country!  https://t.co/8SpeChxEyL
2021-01-07  Thank you, Mr. #Pompeo, for this vivid lesson. Thanks to it, we #Chinese cherish our life &amp; love our country even more. We are also more convinced that the path we've chosen is correct.
2021-01-04  The right to life is the most basic #humanright. The number of confirmed cases in the #US has surpassed 20 million, with over 350,000 deaths. But has Mr. #Pompeo expressed any sympathy for all these lives lost? What has he done to save these lives?  https://t.co/guyLeK6VvJ
2020-12-08  #Pompeo is right in saying "this isn't about America vs. China". This is indeed about a few Americans' hypocritical values of human rights, democracy vs. mankind's shared values &amp; US unilateral bullying, hegemony vs. multilateralism, international justice.  https://t.co/C42bhcIsjs
2020-12-08  Sec. #Pompeo announced sanctions on vice chairpersons of China's NPCSC. This is serious violation of basic norms of international relations&amp;interference in China's internal affairs. China will take firm&amp;strong countermeasures to defend sovereignty, security&amp;development interests.  https://t.co/36mWxrRfYU
2020-12-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: We oppose &amp; condemn malign attacks by Sec. #POMPEO against China's political system &amp; further restrictions on people-to-people exchange. Inciting ideological confrontation will only further sabotage China-US relations &amp; is not in the two peoples' interests.
