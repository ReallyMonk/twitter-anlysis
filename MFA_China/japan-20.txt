2021-10-14  RT @zlj517: #Japan's decision to discharge nuclear-contaminated water is a global concern. We hope the new Japanese govt will listen to the call of the people, and reverse the wrong decision.  https://t.co/m3fM1d3skP
2021-09-23  RT @zlj517: #Japan claims its ocean discharge plan is technically "feasible" despite frequent reports on TEPCO's irresponsible &amp; unprofessional operations. Japan's poor technology &amp; supervision, data-tampering &amp; cover-ups give the world every reason to question the "feasibility" of its plan.  https://t.co/vjlHRcUhxf
2021-09-03  It took developed countries one to two hundred years from industrialization to carbon peaking, but took #China only 50-odd years. From carbon peaking to carbon neutrality, #EU will spend 71 years, #US 43 years &amp; #Japan 37 years. But China’s goal is 30 years.  https://t.co/gkjNyQDpGR
2021-09-03  When visitors to the museum stop in front of it, they may get a touch of the passage of history. They could see that the friendship between #China and #Japan needs to be built on the respect for history.
2021-09-03  Today, the Annotated Collection on the Songs of Chu, one of the witnesses of the normalization of #China-#Japan diplomatic relations, lies quietly in the glass cabinet of the museum.
2021-08-27  RT @zlj517: #Japan deliberately released a children's version of its defense white paper, repeating old rhetoric to smear&amp;criticize China. We firmly oppose this&amp;have lodged solemn representations. To highlight external threat&amp;sow the seed of confrontation in young minds is not constructive.  https://t.co/gYBfrK4Mpr
2021-08-05  RT @SpokespersonCHN: Wang Yi Sternly Refutes Fallacious Remarks by the #UnitedStates and #Japan that Interfere in #China's Internal Affairs.  https://t.co/LAKLW9THS5  https://t.co/sjWlS2RLly
2021-06-03  On the issue of the disposal of the nuclear contaminated water from #Fukushima, we once again ask #Japan to revoke the selfish and irresponsible decision and avoid being a trouble-maker.  https://t.co/jTL7G0xnEN
2021-06-02  Wang Yi said the disposal of #Fukushima contaminated water concerns the ecological security of global marine environment &amp; the life and health of people in all countries. #Japan must not turn a deaf ear to the concerns and discharge the nuclear waste water as it wishes.
2021-05-27  Why hasn't the Japanese politician who claims that the treated nuclear contaminated water is safe to drink taken a sip yet? When will #Japan take domestic &amp; international concern seriously &amp; withdraw its wrong decision?
2021-05-27  #Japan claims its disposal is safe &amp; reliable, but has that been verified by any stakeholders? Given #TEPCO's poor record of cover-ups &amp; false reports, how can Japan guarantee its information &amp; data is authentic?  https://t.co/iCDcHskJ1W
2021-05-27  #Pakistani Senator Dr. Afnan Ullah Khan denounced the unilateral decision and urged Japan to reverse it. Pakistani fishermen also staged a protest at Gwadar Press Club. All this shows that #Japan's wrong decision is being rejected by more &amp; more countries.
2021-05-22  #Japan, with its belligerent moves, attempts to return to the old path of military expansion as it did in #WWII. It joined #US in flexing muscles everywhere while criticizing others' normal military development. Outrageous!  https://t.co/VtHPWT69J7
2021-05-14  Do #Japan, the #US &amp; #France really think a joint military exercise  could intimidate #China? There are US aircraft and ships aggressively patrolling China’s borders, but no Chinese aircraft and ships off America’s coast.  https://t.co/a5m8RKuVAW
2021-04-28  It is extremely irresponsible of #Japan to opt for sea discharge to cut expenses. It made the wrong decision first and we only protested afterwards. How come it is brazen enough to do the wrong thing, but won't stand others' criticism?  https://t.co/YTyYuhOt2Z
2021-04-28  As a matter of fact, #China was not alone. Many governments, international organizations, over 300 environmental groups and people in various countries including #Japan have raised strong objection and grave concern.  https://t.co/wMZ2KSXFN9
2021-04-24  Japanese DM's remarks on #DiaoyuDao is totally groundless and extremely irresponsible. When politicians in charge are misleading people, how can we expect ordinary people in #Japan to view #China objectively &amp; build up confidence in China-Japan relations?  https://t.co/ofmFzDiC16
2021-04-24  How the contaminated water from #Fukushima nuclear plant is handled is by no means a domestic matter of #Japan. If the water is as safe as Japan claims it to be, why doesn't Japan keep it?  https://t.co/3mxs0O5i73
2021-04-12  #China has expressed grave concern to #Japan through diplomatic channel over its decision to discharge nuclear wastewater into the sea. Japan should handle the issue prudently and act in a responsible manner for global public interests and the interests of its own people.
2021-03-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: For the #China-#Japan relationship to be more mature and stable, the two countries need to stay focused without being distracted by any single event.
