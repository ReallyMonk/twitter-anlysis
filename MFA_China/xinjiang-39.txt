2021-06-30  We hope that the Canadian people can view the development of #Xinjiang in an objective and impartial light, and avoid being blinded by lies.  https://t.co/kn8VuWYTh2
2021-06-26  The #US Fact Sheet on "forced labor" in #Xinjiang is nothing but a list of lies.  https://t.co/Kez70Uzgh6
2021-06-24  #China rejects &amp; condemns #US sanctions on Chinese companies based on lies &amp; disinformation. The US is using human rights as a disguise to suppress the industrial development in #Xinjiang, create forced unemployment &amp; poverty, mess up Xinjiang &amp; contain China's development.  https://t.co/gGgPJZW9OZ
2021-06-03  The so-called "Uyghur Tribunal" is neither legal nor credible. It will only make it easier for the world to see through the lies and rumors relating to #Xinjiang.  https://t.co/bBFlOLZlrW
2021-05-24  Given that BBC went so low with a royal celebrity, just imagine how ugly &amp; hypocritical its geopolitical &amp; ideological coverage is. It fabricated &amp; spread so much disinformation on #China’s #Xinjiang.
2021-05-15  The #US hypocrisy and conspiracy of creating "#HumanRights issues" in #Xinjiang to mess up and contain #China have been seen through by more and more people, including our #African brothers.  https://t.co/c12rtVb7rK
2021-05-14  We welcome all unbiased people to visit #Xinjiang. That said, we firmly reject so-called investigation with presumption of guilt by citing lies and rumors.
2021-05-14  They would rather play along with the clumsy show of a handful of anti-China forces than face up to the development and progress in #Xinjiang.
2021-05-14  Those Western countries would rather believe the lies concocted by a few people than heed the voice of the 25 million people of all ethnic groups in #Xinjiang and the 1.4 billion Chinese.
2021-05-14  If they truly care about human rights, why didn’t they invite residents from #Xinjiang to attend the event? If they truly care about human rights, why don’t they reflect upon and redress serious racial discriminatory polices and behavior at home?
2021-05-14  The #US, #UK&amp; #Germany ganged up with some NGOs to host a virtual conference on #Xinjiang’s human rights situation based on lies&amp;political prejudice falsely in the name of UN.  https://t.co/OjxqhIWux1
2021-05-12  They want to create "forced industrial decoupling" &amp; "forced unemployment" in #Xinjiang to serve their malicious agenda to disrupt Xinjiang and contain #China.
2021-05-11  Some in the #US buy the "account" of the few false witnesses and experts, but refuse to listen to the voices far outnumbering those of false actors, and heed the call of 1.4 billion #Chinese people, including over 25 million people of all ethnic groups in #Xinjiang.
2021-05-11  #Sweden-based TFF stressed "report" on genocide in #Xinjiang lacks credibility and the relevant #US think tank has obvious political aims.  https://t.co/18LSK996ZE
2021-04-27  The script of making up lies on #Xinjiang: revelation by so-called “academics” or “victims” first, hype-up by media then, intervention from governments or parliaments in the end.  https://t.co/n5RBG5m9Bf
2021-04-24  We find "The #Xinjiang Genocide Allegations Are Unjustified" carried by the #US-based media organization Project Syndicate objective and informative. We applaud its just voice on Xinjiang related issues.  https://t.co/c8n9TJWCSl
2021-04-14  The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) said on Twitter that they have funded separatist forces in #Xinjiang since 2004. Have a look at the self-styled flag of East Turkestan.  https://t.co/1anb1FUFqo
2021-04-06  Please watch the 4th and latest #CGTN documentary on fighting terrorism in #Xinjiang. Facts abound to dispel the fallacies of the so-called "excessive counter-terrorism" &amp; "genocide" in Xinjiang, and expose the true face of the #ETIM, a terrorist organization through and through.
2021-04-02  French media reported on "paid labor" in prison &amp; lauded the practice. Good. But when prisoners in France have the right to improve employment skills through paid work so they can pursue a happy life after release, why can't the innocent ethnic minorities in #Xinjiang ...
2021-04-01  This only exposes its hypocrisy behind all the talk about rule of law &amp; rules. It’s also evidence that the US strategic conspiracy is to destabilize #Xinjiang to contain China’s development, as Lawrence Wilkerson admitted.  https://t.co/W8g3bj3y6k
2021-04-01  The few so-called “witnesses” are just trained “actors”. Not just #Xinjiang, people outside China, including in the US, have all exposed &amp; refuted the lies in various ways.
2021-03-30  #BCI Shanghai representative office stated: "Since 2012, the #Xinjiang project site has performed second-party credibility audits and third-party verifications over the years, and has never found a single case related to incidents of forced labor."
2021-03-30  Some repeatedly allege that there is "#ForcedLabor" in #Xinjiang. But what's their evidence? Just the words of rumor-producers&amp;spreaders.  https://t.co/sRz98utnnR
2021-03-29  #China has invited #UNHRC to visit #Xinjiang. The two sides have been in communication over the trip. The purpose should be to promote exchange &amp; cooperation, not to conduct so-called "investigation" based on presumption of guilt.  https://t.co/AN3ziJvgKa
2021-03-29  Speaking of backstage manipulation, Wilkerson's speech at Ron Paul Institute exposed the shocking conspiracy of the US &amp; West: to destabilize #Xinjiang &amp; contain China's development. The cotton smears are just part of the bigger plot.  https://t.co/Tm527Sdiwv
2021-03-29  Some accuse the Chinese government of fanning nationalism. Well, foreign brands refuse to use #Xinjiang cotton based on nothing but lies. This is more than enough to trigger indignation among the Chinese people.  https://t.co/BAqUWIBPq9
2021-03-29  #BCI’s Shanghai office said it has not found a single case of "forced labor" in #Xinjiang. Then how was the conclusion of "forced labor" in Xinjiang reached? Show your evidence!  https://t.co/hOT4oPxHqe
2021-03-29  In 2020, 69.83% of all cotton in #Xinjiang was harvested mechanically instead of manually. Cotton growers can order mechanical pickers through APP on their cellphone, a true symbol of the Internet+ era in cotton harvest.  https://t.co/NoBTt7wzb4
2021-03-24  According to #US media, in 2016, a #Uyghur couple went to Italy with 3 children, leaving another 4 in #Xinjiang. If there's "forced sterilization" and "genocide" in Xinjiang as some in the west claim, how come this Uyghur couple have 7 children?
2021-03-23  Some in the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU clearly don't want to acknowledge the real facts about #Xinjiang &amp; don't care about the truth, but hold on to accusations based on lies &amp; false information. They just do not want to see #China's success, development and better livelihood.
2021-03-23  In 40 years, the #Uyghur population has grown from 5.5 million to 12.8 million. The fact that #Xinjiang residents of various ethnic groups enjoy stability, security, development and progress, makes it one of the most successful human rights stories.
2021-03-22  #China deplores and rejects the unilateral sanctions by #EU citing so-called #HumanRights issues in #Xinjiang. This move is based on nothing but lies and disinformation, and will inevitably undermine China-EU relations.
2021-03-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: The claim that there is genocide in #Xinjiang couldn't be more preposterous. It is just a rumor fabricated with ulterior motives, and a lie through and through.
2021-01-20  #Pompeo's lies are an affront to the 1.4 billion Chinese people including 25 million #Xinjiang residents &amp; to the intelligence of the American people and the international community. He has betrayed &amp; challenged the basic moral standard &amp; human conscience.
2021-01-20  The life expectancy of #Xinjiang residents grew from 30 to 72 over the past 60 years or so. The Uyghur population increased by 25.04% from 2010-2018, much higher than the 2% growth rate of the Han population.
2021-01-20  In 2019, #Xinjiang received 200+ million domestic &amp; foreign travelers. They saw with their own eyes how beautiful Xinjiang is &amp; how people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang enjoy unity, harmony &amp; happiness.
2021-01-20  "China committing genocide &amp; crimes against humanity in #Xinjiang" only exists in #Pompeo's ugly political conspiracies. It has never happened and will never happen in our country!  https://t.co/8SpeChxEyL
2021-01-11  .@IRF_Ambassador is a joke. He made so many slanders against China &amp; created so many lies about #Xinjiang out of stubborn bias.  https://t.co/PFuttkxtYF
2020-10-26  From Oct 19 to 22, diplomatic envoys posted in China from 20 Arab states and the Arab League visited #Xinjiang. Seeing is believing. Facts speak louder than words. China welcomes friends from Muslim countries, including Arab states, and the wider world to Xinjiang for a visit.  https://t.co/fZtfmwvNgL
