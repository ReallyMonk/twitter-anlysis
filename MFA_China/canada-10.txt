2021-09-27  The news of Meng Wanzhou’s return to China got 400 mil thumbs-ups on the online platform of the #China Media Group on the night of Sept. 25, a number larger than the combined populations of the #US and #Canada.  https://t.co/q8WD6Iw24Z
2021-09-06  #China firmly opposes &amp; strongly condemns #Canada’s wanton interference in China’s judicial sovereignty. About 15 mln people signed the petition calling for the immediate &amp; unconditional release of Meng Wanzhou. Canada should correct its mistake &amp; ensure her safe return to China.  https://t.co/uDSjyCikh3
2021-07-02  We urge #Canada to completely redress the injustice of suppression against the indigenous people with 10 times the effort it makes now.  https://t.co/69KF8M71Hb
2021-06-26  751 unmarked graves were discovered on the grounds of a former residential school in #Canada, over three times of the 215 bodies of Indigenous children found earlier.  https://t.co/fDiGE16sYJ
2021-06-23  RT @SpokespersonCHN: The #US, #Canada &amp;the #UK should feel ashamed for their blind eyes to their own shocking #humanrights records and  sheer lies &amp;evil-purposed interference in China's internal affairs.  Justice will prevail.  https://t.co/RcAVaf4y5y
2021-06-07  We urge relevant officials in the #US and #Canada to discard double standards on human rights issues and stop using #OlympicGames to serve selfish political gains, which is opposite to the will of athletes and winter sports-lovers worldwide.  https://t.co/53ZIGLmjxW
2021-03-24  The #US, #UK and #Canada together account for only 5.7% of the world's population. Even if #EU is added, that will be about 11%. They cannot represent the international community.  https://t.co/fZ8KDhBOS9
2021-03-23  What the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU have done is utter denigration and offense to the reputation and dignity of the #Chinese people, blatant interference of China's internal affairs, and grave violation of China's sovereignty and security interests.
2021-03-23  Some in the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU clearly don't want to acknowledge the real facts about #Xinjiang &amp; don't care about the truth, but hold on to accusations based on lies &amp; false information. They just do not want to see #China's success, development and better livelihood.
2021-02-19  The so-called Declaration looks rather like #Canada's confession on the Meng Wanzhou case. If it truly opposes arbitrary detention, it should match words with actions, release Ms. Meng without any delay&amp;ensure her safe return to China.
