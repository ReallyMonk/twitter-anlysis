2021-05-27  #Japan claims its disposal is safe &amp; reliable, but has that been verified by any stakeholders? Given #TEPCO's poor record of cover-ups &amp; false reports, how can Japan guarantee its information &amp; data is authentic?  https://t.co/iCDcHskJ1W
2021-05-24  This is not the first or second time that a similar incident has occurred with #TEPCO. Its preferred choice always seems to be altering data &amp; concealing risks. As usual, it only admits to the truth when everything has been exposed &amp; a hush-up is no longer possible.  https://t.co/Zk5pHk0Zwg
