2021-10-14  RT @zlj517: #Taiwan is #China's Taiwan. The #US is in no position to make irresponsible remarks.  https://t.co/HEasV382IT
2021-10-12  RT @zlj517: #Taiwan, as a province of #China, is not qualified to join the #UnitedNations.  https://t.co/oV60d6XvGg
2021-09-23  RT @zlj517: There is only one #China in the world &amp; #Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. With regard to the #CPTPP, we firmly oppose Taiwan's accession to any agreement or organization of official nature.  https://t.co/nklPXpOzID
2021-08-27  RT @zlj517: #Taiwan is an inalienable part of #China's territory. We firmly oppose all forms of official interaction between Taiwan and countries having diplomatic ties with China. China has lodged solemn representations with #Japan over its security talks with Taiwan.  https://t.co/OlP6X2ix2a
2021-08-05  #Taiwan is an inalienable part of the #Chinese territory. #US arms sale to Taiwan severely violates the one-China principle&amp;the three China-US joint communiques. China will take legitimate&amp;necessary counter-measures in light of the development of the situation.
2021-07-21  RT @zlj517: #China firmly opposes the erroneous words &amp; acts of the #US. #Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. This is a historical &amp; legal fact that cannot be altered. @USAsiaPacific
2021-05-24  We urge relevant countries to be prudent on the #Taiwan question &amp; refrain from playing with fire.
2021-05-11  Isn't it self-contradictory for the #US to pile praise on #Taiwan's anti-epidemic outcomes while pushing the narrative of imperiling global heath objectives? We urge the US to stop hyping up Taiwan-related issues because it is not conducive to global anti-virus cooperation.
2021-05-11  There is an International Health Regulations Contact Point in the #Taiwan region. With the approval of #China's Central Government, the #WHO Secretariat notified health experts in Taiwan three times of information about #COVID19.
2021-05-11  #US narrative that excluding #Taiwan from #WHA will be detrimental to preventing future health crises is a political lie. We shared 52 epidemic-prevention documents with Taiwan in 13 batches. By May 5, the Central Government had given the Taiwan region 152 #COVID19 updates.
2021-05-11  There is only one #China in the world. The participation of China's #Taiwan region in activities of international organizations must be handled in accordance with the one-China principle. This is a key principle established by #UNGA Resolution 2758 and #WHA Resolution 25.1.
2021-05-11  #US Secretary of State Blinken's statement calling for #Taiwan's participation as observer at #WHA gravely violates the one-China principle and three China-US joint communiqués and interferes in #China's domestic affairs. We deplore and reject it.  https://t.co/Yw4C43YDpN
2021-03-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: We hope the new #US administration will appreciate the great sensitivity of the #Taiwan question, and will abide by the one-China principle and the three Sino-US communiqués.
2021-01-08  China firmly opposes #Ambassador Craft's upcoming visit to #Taiwan. It will be a breach of the one-China principle &amp; the explicit commitment made by the US.  https://t.co/LFjAIoWKw4
