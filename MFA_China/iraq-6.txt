2021-06-04  The people who hypes up the #Wuhan lab-leak hypothesis is the same people who fabricated the fake information about #Iraq's "attempt to acquire nuclear weapons" 19 years ago.  https://t.co/5tfbRioB2D
2021-05-14  British forces killed innocent people and committed torture in places like #Iraq and #Afghanistan, but the culprits are sheltered by the government and stay beyond the law. Where is the #UK concern for human rights?
2021-05-11  The #US killed #Muslims more than any other country in the world. As it waged wars and carried out military operations in the name of "counterterrorism" in 80-plus countries, leading to 800,000+ deaths and tens of millions displaced in #Afghanistan, #Iraq and #Syria.  https://t.co/Ts9uEIDjD8
2021-04-08  Sin No.3: Exporting turmoil. Since 2001, the #US staged wars and military operations in about 80 countries in the name of counter-terrorism, costing 800,000 lives including 330,000 civilians and displacing millions in #Afghanistan, #Iraq and #Syria.
2021-03-30  Remember what the #US &amp; some of its allies did to #Iraq, #Syria &amp; #Libya? Waged wars based on "evidence" which later proved to be false. The price is death &amp; displacement of millions of #Muslims. Justice may be late, but will prevail in the end.  https://t.co/aWdWEDAqSg
2021-03-23  The #US and #UK used some test tube of washing powder and a staged video as evidence to launch wars against sovereign countries such as #Iraq and #Syria, leaving numerous death and displacement. Shouldn't they be sanctioned?
