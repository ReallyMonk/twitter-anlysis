2021-08-25  If the #US is so obsessed with the lab leak theory, then it should first invite #WHO to investigate #FortDetrick &amp; University of North Carolina.  https://t.co/ovqvYXxX9o  https://t.co/Uputu7PoMW
2021-08-13  #Chinese experts also took the initiative to submit to #WHO Chinaâ€™s proposal on the second phase of origins-tracing.
2021-08-13  In March this year, #WHO officially released the Joint Report by the WHO-#China joint study team, which provides the most authoritative, professional and science-based conclusions on origins-tracing and sets out detailed recommendations for future work in origins-tracing.
2021-08-13  He pointed out that #China has all along taken a scientific attitude as it engages in global cooperation on science-based #OriginsTracing. China invited #WHO experts to China twice for origins-tracing research.
2021-08-09  Wall of silence around #FortDetrick is falling down.#Philippine scholars petition for #WHO probe into the notorious #US biolab,with more people from #ASEAN expected to join.Similar petition has garnered 25 million signatures in #China alone. Call for justice is not to be ignored.
2021-07-31  RT @zlj517: The US should invite #WHO to investigate the University of North Carolina. The team of Ralph Baric has extremely mature capability in synergizing &amp; modifying coronavirus. A probe into his team &amp; lab would clarify whether coronavirus research has created or will create SARS-CoV-2.
2021-05-27  The #US keeps urging "#China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation". Then we ask it to follow China's example and immediately start science-based cooperation with #WHO...  https://t.co/YGLZIeAS0l
2021-05-11  There is an International Health Regulations Contact Point in the #Taiwan region. With the approval of #China's Central Government, the #WHO Secretariat notified health experts in Taiwan three times of information about #COVID19.
2021-05-11  Since 2020, health experts in Taiwan have participated in 16 #WHO technical activities, including important meetings like the fourth Global #Vaccine and Immunization Research Forum and WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization meetings.
2021-04-01  We believe the joint #WHO-China study will help stimulate global cooperation in origin-tracing.
2021-03-30  #WHO DG Tedros says the inequitable distribution of #vaccines is a moral outrage. Agree. #China has been providing vaccine assistance to 80 countries &amp; 3 intl organizations, exporting to 40+ countries, and in R&amp;D and production cooperation with 10+.  https://t.co/C6aMehTxVc
2021-03-29  With all its latest rhetoric, is the #US trying to exert pressure on the #WHO mission? Why not ask the experts which part of the report the Chinese government "helped to write"? Is it calling our facilitation for the WHO mission's work backstage manipulation?
2021-03-29  On #COVID19 origin-tracing, when will the #US show the same openness &amp; transparency as #China? When will it invite #WHO experts in to investigate? When will it open up #FortDetrick to international experts for probe or research?  https://t.co/BcQS9cJqrH
2021-02-19  These are reported by American media. People are curious whether the #US will make public relevant raw data, offer #WHO its unreserved&amp;full cooperation&amp;invite WHO experts on an independent origin-tracing mission in the country?
2021-01-11  After consultations, China has agreed that the #WHO expert panel will come to China on Jan. 14th, where scientists &amp; medical professionals on both sides will cooperate on tracing the origins of the novel coronavirus.  https://t.co/hSW7hU2nUV
