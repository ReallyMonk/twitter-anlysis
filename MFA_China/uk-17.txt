2021-05-14  British forces killed innocent people and committed torture in places like #Iraq and #Afghanistan, but the culprits are sheltered by the government and stay beyond the law. Where is the #UK concern for human rights?
2021-05-14  The #US, #UK&amp; #Germany ganged up with some NGOs to host a virtual conference on #Xinjiang’s human rights situation based on lies&amp;political prejudice falsely in the name of UN.  https://t.co/OjxqhIWux1
2021-04-22  The #UK side has peremptoriness in spreading lies &amp; disinformation, smearing &amp; attacking others on their human rights situation, but lacks the courage to face and address its own human rights problems. This is nothing short of hypocritical double standards.  https://t.co/4gCSSb969h
