2021-09-27  The #CPC and the #Chinese government have the firm will and strong capability to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens and companies as well as the interests and dignity of #China.
2021-09-27  Justice may be late, but never absent. A strong #China under the leadership of the #CPC will always have the back of every single #Chinese citizen.
2021-09-11  RT @zlj517: The #Chinese people are very angry. Can the #US also express the same readiness to sign a "no back door" agreement as #Huawei does?  https://t.co/HaNK70sxms
2021-09-08  The #Chinese government has stepped up anti-monopoly regulation, which will fundamentally promote fair, orderly and sustainable growth &amp; development of the Chinese economy, and will be good for the world economy in the long run.  https://t.co/nMHRYmRpvT
2021-09-03  The #Chinese and #Russian people will not allow any attempt to negate or even beautify the history of aggression, nor will the peace-loving people of the whole world.  https://t.co/tTOI8lv6cK
2021-08-13  #Chinese experts also took the initiative to submit to #WHO Chinaâ€™s proposal on the second phase of origins-tracing.
2021-08-05  #Taiwan is an inalienable part of the #Chinese territory. #US arms sale to Taiwan severely violates the one-China principle&amp;the three China-US joint communiques. China will take legitimate&amp;necessary counter-measures in light of the development of the situation.
2021-07-07  #Chinese is the most spoken language in the world.  https://t.co/4i67kcGMNv
2021-07-02  The #Chinese vaccines are the first batch of doses available to many developing countries.  https://t.co/wTJwlf5KVc
2021-05-20  From May 4 to 18, another #Chinese medical expert team joined the #Lao people in fighting the #COVID19 virus. Together, we will secure an early victory!  https://t.co/DE91hM5YM8
2021-05-12  Republican congressmen proposed to set up 56 #FBI posts to supervise #Chinese students in American universities. Perhaps they should set up 300,000 FBI posts or at least 150,000 because there are more than 300,000 Chinese students in the US.  https://t.co/d4n9RhfNXj
2021-05-11  Some in the #US buy the "account" of the few false witnesses and experts, but refuse to listen to the voices far outnumbering those of false actors, and heed the call of 1.4 billion #Chinese people, including over 25 million people of all ethnic groups in #Xinjiang.
2021-05-07  RT @China2ASEAN: A team of #Chinese medical experts, along w/ medical materials,  arrived in #Lao capital Vientiane on Tuesday to assist Laos in fight #COVID19Pandemic.

2021-03-25  Providing convenience to those inoculated with #Chinese #vaccines does not affect the existing policy for those who haven't. In the meantime, necessary quarantine and observation measures for all inbound personnel will continue to be implemented.  https://t.co/OcS4vlWdDJ
2021-03-23  What the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU have done is utter denigration and offense to the reputation and dignity of the #Chinese people, blatant interference of China's internal affairs, and grave violation of China's sovereignty and security interests.
2021-03-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: We will launch a #SpringVaccinationProgram to assist and secure #vaccination for our citizens with #Chinese or foreign #vaccines.
2021-03-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: In #Chinese culture, seeking harmony without uniformity is a philosophy of the virtuous. #Western culture values respect as a quality of a gentleman.
2021-03-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: Whether it is a #Chinese vaccine or not, it is a good vaccine so long as it is safe and effective.
2021-01-07  Thank you, Mr. #Pompeo, for this vivid lesson. Thanks to it, we #Chinese cherish our life &amp; love our country even more. We are also more convinced that the path we've chosen is correct.
