2021-08-25  If the #US is so obsessed with the lab leak theory, then it should first invite #WHO to investigate #FortDetrick &amp; University of North Carolina.  https://t.co/ovqvYXxX9o  https://t.co/Uputu7PoMW
2021-08-17  A thorough investigation into #FortDetrick will clear the doubts.   https://t.co/j1mcDNvHat
2021-08-09  Wall of silence around #FortDetrick is falling down.#Philippine scholars petition for #WHO probe into the notorious #US biolab,with more people from #ASEAN expected to join.Similar petition has garnered 25 million signatures in #China alone. Call for justice is not to be ignored.
2021-07-21  RT @zlj517: #FortDetrick remains shrouded in secrecy. Just after #US CDC halted most of its research, unexplained outbreaks of respiratory disease appeared in northern #Virginia, EVALI broke out in #Wisconsin, retirement communities near the base experienced unexplained pneumonia outbreaks.  https://t.co/Cke9cojFSa
2021-07-21  RT @zlj517: Even so, the reason for its closure is withheld for "national security reasons". More disturbingly, #FortDetrick stores biological warfare research from #NaziGermany &amp; #Unit731 of the Imperial Japanese Army &amp; highly dangerous viruses.
2021-05-27  What secrets are hidden in suspicion-shrouded #FortDetrick &amp; the 200+ #US bio-labs all over the world? In July 2019, there were reports on the unexplained outbreaks of respiratory disease in northern Virginia and on the subsequent EVALI outbreaks in Wisconsin.  https://t.co/EeaDkGYoJm
2021-04-28  The #US cannot stop talking about #China, but what about itself? With so many questions on earlier #COVID19 cases &amp; the #EVALI outbreak, can the US be transparent &amp; disclose detailed information? Why not open up #FortDetrick for investigation by international experts?  https://t.co/lR5nvn3knu
2021-03-29  On #COVID19 origin-tracing, when will the #US show the same openness &amp; transparency as #China? When will it invite #WHO experts in to investigate? When will it open up #FortDetrick to international experts for probe or research?  https://t.co/BcQS9cJqrH
