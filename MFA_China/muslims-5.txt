2021-05-15  The #US claims that it cares about the #HumanRights of #Muslims. But it turns a blind eye to the sufferings of #Palestinian Muslims in recent clashes between #Israel and #Palestine.  https://t.co/EPsqNOm8hI
2021-05-14  The #US waged wars and military operations in Iraq, #Libya, #Syria, #Afghanistan and other countries in the name of “fighting terrorism”, taking the lives of over a million #Muslims and displacing tens of millions. Where is the US concern for human rights?
2021-05-14  The #US claims loudly enough that it is concerned about the human rights of #Muslims. However, it is exactly the US and its accomplices that have killed the most Muslims.
2021-05-11  The #US killed #Muslims more than any other country in the world. As it waged wars and carried out military operations in the name of "counterterrorism" in 80-plus countries, leading to 800,000+ deaths and tens of millions displaced in #Afghanistan, #Iraq and #Syria.  https://t.co/Ts9uEIDjD8
2021-03-30  Remember what the #US &amp; some of its allies did to #Iraq, #Syria &amp; #Libya? Waged wars based on "evidence" which later proved to be false. The price is death &amp; displacement of millions of #Muslims. Justice may be late, but will prevail in the end.  https://t.co/aWdWEDAqSg
