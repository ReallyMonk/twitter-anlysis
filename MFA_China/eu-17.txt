2021-09-03  It took developed countries one to two hundred years from industrialization to carbon peaking, but took #China only 50-odd years. From carbon peaking to carbon neutrality, #EU will spend 71 years, #US 43 years &amp; #Japan 37 years. But China’s goal is 30 years.  https://t.co/gkjNyQDpGR
2021-07-25  We hope that #Finland, by leveraging its unique advantages, will work with #China to promote the development of China-#EU green and digital partnership, and improve liberalization and facilitation of China-EU trade and investment.  https://t.co/uaJ6t6B75m
2021-07-24  We hope #Malta will continue speaking up with objective and rational voice, enhance mutual understanding and trust between #China and #EU, and play a constructive role in promoting sound development of China-EU relationship.  https://t.co/XTfQnD6xXz
2021-07-24  The three components of #EU’s positioning of #China are contradictory and offset each other.  https://t.co/NI5XMmMsOl
2021-05-30  We stand ready to work together with European countries and EU institutions to strengthen our cooperation along the right track of a deepened #China-#EU comprehensive strategic partnership.  https://t.co/ZfWWZV5hqQ
2021-05-06  The #EU has been tightening restrictions on #vaccine exports, and some countries have hoarded vaccines far in excess of their population's needs. Isn't this "vaccine nationalism"? Isn't this creating a "vaccine divide"? How many vaccines has the EU given to developing countries?  https://t.co/2so4OesBES
2021-03-25  .@Europarl_EN The #China-#EU investment agreement is not a "gift" from one side to the other, but rather mutually beneficial.  https://t.co/N6vO3TZhM4
2021-03-25  What happened is clear. The #EU made provocation first, by attacking &amp; sanctioning #China based on lies. China's reaction is necessary and justified. China doesn't seek trouble, but if trouble comes, we don't shy away.  https://t.co/8Wxlb8p462
2021-03-25  Speaking of "accountability", I wonder how is #Australia doing with those investigations into grave crimes in #Afghanistan? Will the "#FiveEyes" alliance and the #EU hold Australia accountable?  https://t.co/aPfYu2ennF
2021-03-24  The #US, #UK and #Canada together account for only 5.7% of the world's population. Even if #EU is added, that will be about 11%. They cannot represent the international community.  https://t.co/fZ8KDhBOS9
2021-03-23  #France, #UK and #EU launched a war in #Libya, leading to regional turbulence &amp; grave migrant and refugee issues. Shouldn't they be held accountable?
2021-03-23  What the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU have done is utter denigration and offense to the reputation and dignity of the #Chinese people, blatant interference of China's internal affairs, and grave violation of China's sovereignty and security interests.
2021-03-23  Some in the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU clearly don't want to acknowledge the real facts about #Xinjiang &amp; don't care about the truth, but hold on to accusations based on lies &amp; false information. They just do not want to see #China's success, development and better livelihood.
2021-03-22  The #EU must drop its hypocritical double standards, and stop going further down the wrong path. Otherwise, it will be met with further resolute reactions.
2021-03-22  To safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interest, #China will sanction #EU individuals and entities that have been spreading lies and disinformation at the cost of China's interests.  https://t.co/4fDdRcqSgq
2021-03-22  #China deplores and rejects the unilateral sanctions by #EU citing so-called #HumanRights issues in #Xinjiang. This move is based on nothing but lies and disinformation, and will inevitably undermine China-EU relations.
2021-02-19  GREAT NEWS: China is the #EU's biggest trade partner in 2020, a historical first!  https://t.co/OueW1vw63z
