2021-07-12  RT @zlj517: It's hypocritical for #Australia to point fingers at others' #HumanRights conditions based on lies, while turning a blind eye to its own human rights abuses. Australia needs to do some soul-searching &amp; put its own house in order.  https://t.co/kddyOnTyvr
2021-07-12  RT @zlj517: Some western countries like to advertise themselves as "defenders" of #HumanRights, but ads are just ads. Whether a country is doing a good job in protecting human rights, its people are in the best position to judge.  https://t.co/ocnfSph04u
2021-06-23  RT @SpokespersonCHN: The #US, #Canada &amp;the #UK should feel ashamed for their blind eyes to their own shocking #humanrights records and  sheer lies &amp;evil-purposed interference in China's internal affairs.  Justice will prevail.  https://t.co/RcAVaf4y5y
2021-05-15  The #US claims that it cares about the #HumanRights of #Muslims. But it turns a blind eye to the sufferings of #Palestinian Muslims in recent clashes between #Israel and #Palestine.  https://t.co/EPsqNOm8hI
2021-05-15  The #US hypocrisy and conspiracy of creating "#HumanRights issues" in #Xinjiang to mess up and contain #China have been seen through by more and more people, including our #African brothers.  https://t.co/c12rtVb7rK
2021-05-11  #US website Counterpunch's article also said US interest in the fate of #Uyghurs is motivated by geopolitics rather than care for #HumanRights. This view is widely shared.  https://t.co/GpVfKFKcc8
2021-04-08  Sin No.4: Interventionism. Hiding behind the banner of #HumanRights, the US has launched strikes against sovereign countries in defiance of the UN Charter. How could there be unbroken eggs under a toppled nest? How could human rights be protected if national sovereignty is lost?
2021-04-08  Sin No.2: #Racism. After the onset of #COVID19, hate crimes against #Asians grew by 150% since March 2020. During this year's UPR at the UNHRC, over 110 countries criticized #US #HumanRights conditions and urged it to address racial discrimination and other systemic problems.
2021-04-08  The #US has been using #HumanRights as a fig leaf in a vain attempt to cover the sins of human rights violation it has committed. Here is some of its sins recorded in history and proved by facts: colonialism, racism, exporting turmoil, interventionism and double standards.  https://t.co/Vy4El38uxr
2021-04-08  The more diligently the #US works to invent lies on #China's #HumanRights conditions and paint itself as human rights defender, the more it exposes its guilty conscience burdened by grave human rights problems at home. Such attempts at deflecting attention will fool no one.  https://t.co/LWwxzqvXNB
2021-04-08  The #US should take a hard look at its own #HumanRights issues and take concrete measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the indigenous residents of #Guam.
2021-03-25  The frequent occurrence of violent crimes of racial discrimination, including the latest ones in #Atlanta&amp; #Colorado, reflects the #US failure in safeguarding #humanrights of its own people. US is urged to honor its commitment &amp; take concrete steps to protect its people's lives.  https://t.co/B5MzaOEiwZ
2021-03-23  How can people enjoy rights if they lost their lives? Some in the west talk a lot about #humanrights, but who and what right on earth are they protecting? In what way are they respecting and protecting human rights?
2021-03-22  #China deplores and rejects the unilateral sanctions by #EU citing so-called #HumanRights issues in #Xinjiang. This move is based on nothing but lies and disinformation, and will inevitably undermine China-EU relations.
2021-01-06  The Chinese government's commitment to #HumanRights remains firm while U.S. politicians' slogans quickly fade away. With more than 20 million confirmed cases &amp; 350k deaths in the US, have they shown any grief or done anything to help?  https://t.co/iPbzHbIk5T
2021-01-06  #HumanRights are concrete &amp; tangible, not just an empty slogan. The most basic human right is the right to life. Amid the pandemic, that means the right &amp; freedom to stay safe &amp; sound.  https://t.co/qGQNpvLHmk
2021-01-04  This is blatant disregard of and truly disdain for #humanrights!
