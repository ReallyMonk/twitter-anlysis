2021-09-16  RT @zlj517: The #FBI recently identified 7,759 hate crimes in 2020, up 6% y-o-y, the highest since 2008. The number of attacks targeting African Americans rose from 1,930 to 2,755; those targeting Asians rose from 158 to 274. Most of the rise is attributed to racially motivated crimes.  https://t.co/quYfz1mJVG
2021-05-12  Republican congressmen proposed to set up 56 #FBI posts to supervise #Chinese students in American universities. Perhaps they should set up 300,000 FBI posts or at least 150,000 because there are more than 300,000 Chinese students in the US.  https://t.co/d4n9RhfNXj
