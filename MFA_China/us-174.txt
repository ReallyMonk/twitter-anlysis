2021-04-08  Sin No.5: Double standards. In 2017, the former #US administration issued the anti-Muslim ban, making the US the only country to have issued a ban targeting the #Muslim community. A US poll showed that over 80% of those surveyed believe Muslims face discrimination in the US.
2021-04-08  Sin No.3: Exporting turmoil. Since 2001, the #US staged wars and military operations in about 80 countries in the name of counter-terrorism, costing 800,000 lives including 330,000 civilians and displacing millions in #Afghanistan, #Iraq and #Syria.
2021-04-08  Sin No.2: #Racism. After the onset of #COVID19, hate crimes against #Asians grew by 150% since March 2020. During this year's UPR at the UNHRC, over 110 countries criticized #US #HumanRights conditions and urged it to address racial discrimination and other systemic problems.
2021-04-08  Sin No.1: #Colonialism. The #US committed genocide and crimes against humanity. Over the 100 years after US founding, native Indians were expelled and killed during the Westward Expansion. Their population plunged from 5 mln in late 15th century to 0.25 mln in early 20th century.
2021-04-08  The #US has been using #HumanRights as a fig leaf in a vain attempt to cover the sins of human rights violation it has committed. Here is some of its sins recorded in history and proved by facts: colonialism, racism, exporting turmoil, interventionism and double standards.  https://t.co/Vy4El38uxr
2021-04-08  The more diligently the #US works to invent lies on #China's #HumanRights conditions and paint itself as human rights defender, the more it exposes its guilty conscience burdened by grave human rights problems at home. Such attempts at deflecting attention will fool no one.  https://t.co/LWwxzqvXNB
2021-04-08  The #US should take a hard look at its own #HumanRights issues and take concrete measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the indigenous residents of #Guam.
2021-04-06  #Racism is comprehensive, systemic and persistent in the #US. White supremacists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members openly used racist slogans to preach white supremacy, incite racial discrimination and hatred.  https://t.co/IVHVrCWXS2
2021-03-30  Remember what the #US &amp; some of its allies did to #Iraq, #Syria &amp; #Libya? Waged wars based on "evidence" which later proved to be false. The price is death &amp; displacement of millions of #Muslims. Justice may be late, but will prevail in the end.  https://t.co/aWdWEDAqSg
2021-03-29  With all its latest rhetoric, is the #US trying to exert pressure on the #WHO mission? Why not ask the experts which part of the report the Chinese government "helped to write"? Is it calling our facilitation for the WHO mission's work backstage manipulation?
2021-03-29  On #COVID19 origin-tracing, when will the #US show the same openness &amp; transparency as #China? When will it invite #WHO experts in to investigate? When will it open up #FortDetrick to international experts for probe or research?  https://t.co/BcQS9cJqrH
2021-03-26  The #US should take substantive measures to ease its unilateral sanctions on #Iran and long-arm jurisdiction on third parties. Iran, on its part, needs to resume reciprocal compliance with its nuclear commitments. These steps will help bring about an early harvest.  https://t.co/ovNacoWR95
2021-03-25  .@SpeakerPelosi  It's the rights &amp; dignity of minority groups in the #US that need defense. Those elected by American people need do sth to ensure that #GeorgeFloyd can breathe, that #AsianAmericans are free from  hate crimes, that American people's lives are better protected.  https://t.co/s3iPc4s9a2
2021-03-25  The frequent occurrence of violent crimes of racial discrimination, including the latest ones in #Atlanta&amp; #Colorado, reflects the #US failure in safeguarding #humanrights of its own people. US is urged to honor its commitment &amp; take concrete steps to protect its people's lives.  https://t.co/B5MzaOEiwZ
2021-03-24  According to #US media, in 2016, a #Uyghur couple went to Italy with 3 children, leaving another 4 in #Xinjiang. If there's "forced sterilization" and "genocide" in Xinjiang as some in the west claim, how come this Uyghur couple have 7 children?
2021-03-24  The #US, #UK and #Canada together account for only 5.7% of the world's population. Even if #EU is added, that will be about 11%. They cannot represent the international community.  https://t.co/fZ8KDhBOS9
2021-03-23  The #US and #UK used some test tube of washing powder and a staged video as evidence to launch wars against sovereign countries such as #Iraq and #Syria, leaving numerous death and displacement. Shouldn't they be sanctioned?
2021-03-23  What the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU have done is utter denigration and offense to the reputation and dignity of the #Chinese people, blatant interference of China's internal affairs, and grave violation of China's sovereignty and security interests.
2021-03-23  Some in the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU clearly don't want to acknowledge the real facts about #Xinjiang &amp; don't care about the truth, but hold on to accusations based on lies &amp; false information. They just do not want to see #China's success, development and better livelihood.
2021-03-22  #China and #Russia both agree that #US should take a hard look at the damage it has done to world peace and development, stop its bullying practice of ganging up on others and meddling in other countries' internal affairs.  https://t.co/Bcd6O8aVeE
2021-03-22  People in the vast majority of countries, including some US allies, hope to see peaceful co-existence of #China and the #US. The US should stop coercing others into following its footstep to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's interests.  https://t.co/tnUaL574zg
2021-03-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: The #US and #Iran can move forward in a step-by-step and reciprocal manner.
2021-03-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: We hope the #US side will demonstrate sincerity by taking actions as quickly as possible, including removing the unjustified unilateral #sanctions and the "long-arm jurisdiction" on third-party entities and individuals.
2021-03-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: #China welcomes #US return to the #ParisAgreement and expects that the US will shoulder its responsibility and make its due contribution.
2021-03-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: We hope the new #US administration will appreciate the great sensitivity of the #Taiwan question, and will abide by the one-China principle and the three Sino-US communiqu√©s.
2021-03-07  RT @SpokespersonCHN: The one-China principle is the political foundation of the #China-#US relationship, a red line that should not be crossed. On the #Taiwan question, there is no room for compromise or concession from the Chinese government.
2021-02-19  The #US side should heed the voice of its business community, properly deal with economic frictions &amp;  promote sound &amp; steady development of bilateral economic &amp; trade ties.
2021-02-19  The China-US economic &amp; trade relations are, in essence, for mutual benefit. No one will emerge as a winner from a trade war, as proved by this #US Chamber of Commerce report. üîó https://t.co/ip5QqqT0Az  https://t.co/fmf2jtBLs2
2021-02-19  Some in the West including in the #US don't want to hear China's objective&amp;true voice. They fear that more people accessing facts and truth will clip their free rein to spread disinformation&amp;monopolize&amp;sway the international public opinion in whatever ways they like.
2021-02-19  These are reported by American media. People are curious whether the #US will make public relevant raw data, offer #WHO its unreserved&amp;full cooperation&amp;invite WHO experts on an independent origin-tracing mission in the country?
2021-02-19  The #US needs to return to the JCPOA unconditionally ASAP and lift all sanctions on #Iran. Iran thus needs to resume full compliance with the JCPOA. We call on all sides to remain calm, avoid escalating tension and leave room for diplomatic efforts.
2021-02-19  The #US rejoining the #JCPOA is the only correct approach to resolve the impasse on the Iranian nuclear issue. All parties should work together to implement agreements reached at last December's foreign ministers' meeting.
2021-02-19  In terms of military articles export, the Chinese side is always responsible&amp;prudent. China never sells weapons to non-state entities/individuals, which sets us apart in a substantive way from the #US&amp;a few others.
2021-01-22  Some #US politicians have no problem with themselves suppressing others but allow no legitimate self defenses from others. This can only be explained as the logic of bullying, hegemony and power politics.
2021-01-22  According to data from the #US side, the #TrumpAdministration took more than 3,900 distinct sanctions actions in total, or THREE per DAY. Unilateral sanctions are like a boomerang: it is hurled against another, but will inevitably come back to harm oneself.  https://t.co/3tywSVp9SD
2021-01-22  #US &amp; #Russia extending #NewSTART treaty will be conducive to safeguarding global strategic stability and international peace &amp; security. We hope the US will continue to work with Russia to ensure a successful extension of the treaty.  https://t.co/2uYHdrREbA
2021-01-22  "A new day for #US", as said by American media. We wish the same for China-US relations. The past 4 years have seen so many lies,hatred &amp; division sown by certain anti-China politicians. The two peoples have suffered &amp; hope to see ties return to the right track at an early date.  https://t.co/396I3MCN6Y
2021-01-18  #China calls on the #US to heed the concerns of the international community and make real efforts to uphold global strategic stability as well as peace and security in the region and beyond.
2021-01-18  @mfa_russia The #US unilateral withdrawal from the #OpenSkiesTreaty, which has severely hurt trust&amp;transparency mil-to-mil, directly led to #Russia formally exiting the treaty. Russia's efforts to save the treaty were not echoed by the US and other signatories.  https://t.co/55FgsQX52y
2021-01-18  In response to #US interference in HKSAR affairs&amp;judicial sovereignty, #China has decided to reciprocally sanction US personnel of the executive branch,of Congress&amp;NGOs who behave egregiously on&amp;are mainly responsible for Hong Kong-related issues&amp;their immediate family members.  https://t.co/Ei7LKBvRwJ
2021-01-07  The #US shall pay a heavy price for its wrong actions.
2021-01-07  A handful of anti-China politicians in the #US have been staging a final show of madness. They'll stop at nothing to sabotage China-US relations for selfish gains. Such acts will surely be punished by history.  https://t.co/d8zLVNSydH

2021-01-04  RT @SpokespersonCHN: Then why do #US military vessels and aircraft frequently carry out exercises and close-in reconnaissance in the #SouthChinaSea? It is an American fiction for the US to believe that it  has the right to do whatever it wishes to do.  https://t.co/sxDsjspxn7
2021-01-04  The right to life is the most basic #humanright. The number of confirmed cases in the #US has surpassed 20 million, with over 350,000 deaths. But has Mr. #Pompeo expressed any sympathy for all these lives lost? What has he done to save these lives?  https://t.co/guyLeK6VvJ
2021-01-04  Swedish media #DailyNews recently reported on how the #US has pressured #Sweden to exclude #Huawei from its #5G network. Another example showing it is exactly the US that has been practicing coercive diplomacy.  https://t.co/FXABL93Ggi
2020-12-21  #US debe respetar la soberan√≠a e independencia de #Cuba, cesar el bloqueo, sanciones e injerencia. Nos oponemos firmemente a politizar #DerechosHumanos o usar doble est√°ndar. US debe desarrollar relaciones normales con Cuba basadas en la igualdad y el respeto mutuo. @BrunoRguezP

2020-12-03  RT @SpokespersonCHN: The #US practice of integrated military and civilian development dates back to before #WWI. The US groundless accusations against China are typical double standards.
2020-12-02  RT @SpokespersonCHN: China will continue cooperating with other countries including the #US on epidemic prevention and control, and providing as much support and assistance as possible.
2020-12-02  RT @SpokespersonCHN: Many Chinese localities, businesses and groups also donated medical supplies to the #US. Chinese and American pharmaceutical manufacturers and scientists also keep in communication and cooperation on vaccine and medical R &amp; D.
2020-12-02  RT @SpokespersonCHN: China has provided to the #US 39.43bln masks, 800mln pairs of surgical gloves, 650mln protective suits, and 46.762mln pairs of goggles. Dr. Zhong Nanshan and other top experts have shared experience with US clinical doctors via video conferences.
2020-10-09  In the absence of solid evidence, some in the #UK have been following the #US in discriminating against &amp;¬†cracking down on Chinese companies under the pretext of security risks.  https://t.co/HMPyseoBEc
2020-10-09  The difference between China &amp; the #US is not a fight for power, status or between social systems, but about upholding justice or spreading evil, championing multilateralism or unilateralism, advocating win-win cooperation or a zero-sum game.
2020-10-09  #US officials accuse #China of coercing others, but in fact the US is the real master of coercion. It openly threatens to cut cooperation or assistance or slap sanctions. Its message: my way or the high way.  https://t.co/XGyqQnT5ut
2020-10-09  With #COVID19 still spreading, the #US restrictions on transportation of medical supplies pose a direct threat to people's life &amp; health. #China once again calls for the elimination of unilateral compulsory measures on #Iran.
