2021-08-30  The #US should explain this: Why did it ask the intelligence agencies instead of scientists to investigate the origins? Why is it so obsessed with the lab leak theory despite clear lack of scientific evidence? Why has it seen the highest numbers of #COVID19 infection and death?  https://t.co/CZeLrItbKr
2021-08-25  The so-called #COVID19 origins report by #US intelligence is a political report of evidence planting. It‚Äôs impossible for it to reach any scientific conclusion.  https://t.co/n73lCrIizO
2021-08-24  The so-called #COVID19 origins report by #US intelligence set a predetermined conclusion first &amp; came up with a patchwork of far-fetched "evidence" afterwards. Better call it a report of evidence planting.  https://t.co/oQ8NH7mJSC
2021-08-19  #China and #Arab states have joined hands to fight against #COVID19 and set an example of helping each other and overcoming the difficulties together.
2021-08-17  An article published in Vanity Fair in June revealed that a senior #US gov official warned "not to pursue an investigation into the origin of #COVID19" because it would "'open a can of worms' if it continued." What on earth is the US hiding?

2021-07-28  RT @zlj517: In a CGTN Think Tank poll, 80% of the global participants believe origin-tracing of #COVID19 has been politicized. The result indicates people‚Äôs strong discontent with the #US politicization of the scientific issue.  https://t.co/Po4kSbVKxZ

2021-06-09  Some #US politicians have used the pandemic to seek their own agenda, putting politics above science and party interests before the interests of the people, which has cost the #American people dearly and caused serious damage to the int‚Äôl cooperation on #COVID19 response.  https://t.co/b9rDWKlKrm

2021-05-14  This further laid bare their intention to make an issue out of the human rights situation in Xinjiang to disrupt and contain China, and to divert people‚Äôs attention from their own past and on-going human rights crimes and incompetency in domestic governance and #COVID19 response.
2021-05-14  If they truly care about human rights, why are they so callous as millions die of #COVID19 at home?
2021-05-11  There is an International Health Regulations Contact Point in the #Taiwan region. With the approval of #China's Central Government, the #WHO Secretariat notified health experts in Taiwan three times of information about #COVID19.
2021-05-11  #US narrative that excluding #Taiwan from #WHA will be detrimental to preventing future health crises is a political lie. We shared 52 epidemic-prevention documents with Taiwan in 13 batches. By May 5, the Central Government had given the Taiwan region 152 #COVID19 updates.

Why not open up #FortDetrick for investigation by international experts?  https://t.co/lR5nvn3knu

2021-03-24  I wonder in what way the west democracy is superior. Amid #COVID19, the world's richest nations watch hundreds of thousands of their people die. Is this #democracy? While western politicians are busy wooing their party voters, the Chinese government serves all wholeheartedly.
2021-03-23  Tens of hundreds of people died of #COVID19 because these most developed countries are indifferent to their people's rights to life and health. They hoard #vaccines far in excess of their population's needs, leaving developing countries struggling with insufficient vaccines.

2021-01-18  The Chinese side has published a series of reality checks on #COVID19, debunking falsehoods with solid figures&amp;facts. The US government's dismissal of truth precisely reveals the fact that for some US politicians, lies are "facts" as long as they serve to attack and smear China.
2021-01-14  @StateDept @SecPompeo @VOANews The U.S. &amp; several other Western countries made "lies of the century" on China's Xinjiang region. Why on earth do some U.S. politicians think they can lecture China when so many American lives are lost from #COVID19 &amp; people like George Floyd cannot even breathe?
