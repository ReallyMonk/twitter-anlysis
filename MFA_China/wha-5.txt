2021-05-27  #ROK Minister of Health &amp; Welfare Kwon Deok-chul urged the #Japanese government and the international community to strictly verify the safety information of the #Fukushima nuclear contaminated water disposal decision at the #WHA.  https://t.co/R3MTrZonll
2021-05-22  #China's decision to deny Taiwan region access to 2021 #WHA is endorsed by 150+ countries via diplomatic channels. Among them, nearly 80 wrote to WHO to voice support to China. The #US attempt to squeeze Taiwan into WHA has no chance of success!  https://t.co/wZ53UnC2XF
2021-05-11  #US narrative that excluding #Taiwan from #WHA will be detrimental to preventing future health crises is a political lie. We shared 52 epidemic-prevention documents with Taiwan in 13 batches. By May 5, the Central Government had given the Taiwan region 152 #COVID19 updates.
2021-05-11  There is only one #China in the world. The participation of China's #Taiwan region in activities of international organizations must be handled in accordance with the one-China principle. This is a key principle established by #UNGA Resolution 2758 and #WHA Resolution 25.1.
2021-05-11  #US Secretary of State Blinken's statement calling for #Taiwan's participation as observer at #WHA gravely violates the one-China principle and three China-US joint communiqu√©s and interferes in #China's domestic affairs. We deplore and reject it.  https://t.co/Yw4C43YDpN
