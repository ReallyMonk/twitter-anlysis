2021-03-25  What happened is clear. The #EU made provocation first, by attacking &amp; sanctioning #China based on lies. China's reaction is necessary and justified. China doesn't seek trouble, but if trouble comes, we don't shy away.  https://t.co/8Wxlb8p462
2021-03-25  #Guilin scenery is second to none,  so is #China-#Russia partnership, which has contributed  much stability &amp; positivity to the world.

2021-03-24  In Guilin, FM Wang Yi &amp; FM #Lavrov issued a joint statement that shed light on what is real human rights, democracy, international order &amp; multilateralism. #China &amp; #Russia will jointly and resolutely defend international justice &amp; fairness.  https://t.co/9m2i7RyUqK
2021-03-23  The west shall entertain no illusion as regards #China's firm determination to defend national interests and dignity. It's a courtesy to reciprocate what we receive. They will have to pay a price for their ignorance and arrogance.
2021-03-23  #China is not what it was 120 years ago, when foreign powers could force open its door with guns. Certain colluding individuals in politics, academics and media should think twice if they think they could make wanton smears with impunity.
2021-03-23  Some in the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU clearly don't want to acknowledge the real facts about #Xinjiang &amp; don't care about the truth, but hold on to accusations based on lies &amp; false information. They just do not want to see #China's success, development and better livelihood.
2021-03-22  To safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interest, #China will sanction #EU individuals and entities that have been spreading lies and disinformation at the cost of China's interests.  https://t.co/4fDdRcqSgq
2021-03-22  #China deplores and rejects the unilateral sanctions by #EU citing so-called #HumanRights issues in #Xinjiang. This move is based on nothing but lies and disinformation, and will inevitably undermine China-EU relations.
2021-03-22  #China and #Russia both agree that #US should take a hard look at the damage it has done to world peace and development, stop its bullying practice of ganging up on others and meddling in other countries' internal affairs.  https://t.co/Bcd6O8aVeE
2021-03-22  We appreciate Foreign Minister #Lavrov's remarks that #China and #Russia should strengthen high-level collaboration to advance multipolarity. Our cooperation is all the more important in a turbulent world. Surely his visit will further cement our high- level bilateral relations.  https://t.co/ioAQsLgjn6
2021-03-22  People in the vast majority of countries, including some US allies, hope to see peaceful co-existence of #China and the #US. The US should stop coercing others into following its footstep to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's interests.  https://t.co/tnUaL574zg
2021-03-22  The attempt to form a clique to pressure, blackmail, and even intimidate #China by virtue of someone else won't work. There is direct flight between #Canberra and #Beijing. Taking a detour via #WashingtonDC is only counterproductive.  https://t.co/82tgEdGyHO
