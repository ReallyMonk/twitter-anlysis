To ensure the safety of both #elephants&people, by Jun. 10, the local governments have evacuated 2060 households, dispatched a task-force of 1583 men with 370 cars & 11 drones to track elephants' movement and help navigate their way back, & supplied them with 1.2+ tons of food .
Playing mud & enjoying in the rain. The 15 escaped wild elephant in #Yunnan is now on their way back. The continuing rain in recent days offered them the opportunity of mud bath.  
130+ diplomatic envoys visited the #Beijing Daxing International Airport in the sub-center of the city. The airport is a grand project completed during China's the 13th Five-Year Plan period.  
#China's 1st Mars rover #Zhurong, the "photographer", sent back high resolution pictures, including a selfie with the landing platform.  
This young artist in #Foshan painted "Nucleic Acid Testing on the River", a modern version of the famous ancient painting "Along the River During the Qingming Festival". It captures the touching moments of medical workers, volunteers carrying out the testing.  
"What I read in the western press was so different from my experience in #China...Chinese people (are) happy, hard-working, proud and with freedom." "The Chinese government model is a far more effective model for getting things done."
Peter Walker, a well-known #China affairs observer, who has been associated with China for 35 years and paid 80+ visits to China:  
100 Years of the #CPC, 100 Years of Life. Four centenarians from #Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region shared their experience.
Since the fishing ban of naked carp was enforced, local ecology has been improved. The #QinghaiLake had 100,400 tonnes of the fish in 2020, nearly 39 times that of 2002. Over 300,000 migratory birds make a stop at this wintering habitat every year.
#QinghaiLake, #China's largest salt lake, is key to maintaining ecological balance in W China, also a natural barrier for controlling spread of desertification & ensuring safety of agricultural areas in E China. Continuous efforts for environmental protection are now awarding.  
A Most Extraordinary Institution – Martin Jaques Introducing the #ChineseCommunistParty： 
This fully demonstrates the strong resilience and vitality of #China-#EU economic & trade cooperation.
73% companies reported positive earnings before interest & tax (#EBIT). 1/4 of manufacturers are onshoring their supply chains into #China and 51% of companies report their EBIT margins in China were higher than their worldwide average.
It points out that "the resilience of #China's market provided much-needed shelter for European companies amidst the storm of the #COVID19 pandemic".
The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China’s Business Confidence Survey (#BCS) 2021 shows that 60% respondents indicated that they are considering expanding their current China operations in 2021.   
Every country has the legitimate right to  development. No country has the right to deprive the people in other countries of the right to better life. Responsible&respectable country won't behave this way.
How the #US develops itself is its own business. We are happy to see its better development, but reject its suppression and slander against #China.
Visually-impaired test-takers, all 11 of them, took the national college entrance exam, or #gaokao, the annual big event for high school students, using #Braille test papers.  No child will be left behind on the road to a better future.

President Xi sends congratulatory letter to 2nd China-CEEC Expo. In his message, the President reiterated #China's pledge to import goods worth $170 billion from Central&Eastern European Countries (#CEEC) and double CEEC agricultural exports to China in the next 5 years.  
How does the #CPC win wide support from the #Chinese people?  #Uzbek expert Tulanbay Kurbanov gives his observation:  
"Anyone who closes his eyes to the past is blind to the present. Whoever refuses to remember the #inhumanity is prone to new risk of infection." -- on collective forgetting of #slavery in the #US.  
To celebrate the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival, villagers in Tongren,#Guizhou, took part in a zongzi or rice dumplings making competition on June 2. Wrapping zongzi neatly in bamboo leaves, participants showcased their skills that are passed down through families.  
Latest update of #Tianwen1: a new image taken by a high-resolution camera installed on its orbiter shows the landing platform and the #Zhurong Mars rover on the Martian surface.  
And it's not #democracy if  less than 12% of the world’s population try to decide the destiny of rest 88%.  Just like one has no right to force others to take cheese  as the only delicious food in the world.
Real #Democracy means  the majority of  people are  masters of their country, instead of 1% running the country and occupying 99% of the wealth.
According to an internal memo obtained by #VanityFair, former senior official of the #StateDepartment warned not to pursue an investigation into the origin of #COVID19, because it would "open a can of worms" if it continued.  Sooo?  
Today Mme. Zhang Guimei again accompanied her girl students on the journey to #Gaokao, or annual college entrance examination. She has been doing so for 11 years. Gook luck! girls!  
The National College Entrance Examination starts today. Hope Dawa Droma and her classmates from #Tibet can enter their dream schools and continue their basketball. Go for it, girls!  
This is real #genocide.  
Vicissitudes and transformations. #Xinjiang, now China's inland area, was an ocean hundreds of millions of years ago. The Gobi dessert once swept with winds and sand is now turned green. This can also be found in the Loess Plateau.  
People in #Yunnan are very happy with their conservation work. Now 15 escaped wild elephants there have become an instant hit online. They passed towns&villages with a laissez-faire style, drawing global attention. See how funny the video&comments are.  
The memorial of the first National Congress of the Communist Party of China (#CPC) was opened in #Shanghai. It was in this building that the founding fathers of the CPC secretly convened the first National Congress of the Party in 1921.  
For decades, these volunteers have been doing their utmost to help reforest the Gobi Desert to prevent sandstorms and make a better future for the generations ahead.  
It's a delight to see that the Chinese #COVID19 #vaccines have received international recognition for their safety & efficacy.  
 
President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory letter to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (#SCO) non-governmental friendship forum held in #Wuhan. The forum is a key platform for all parties to enhance mutual understanding, deepen friendship and strengthen cooperation.  
Built in 1987, #Urumqi, the Yanghang Mosque with its distinctive green-topped minarets & exquisitely carved pillars is now the venue for praying and worship by not only local Muslims in #Xinjiang but also by those overseas.  
#Xiamen, a coastal city in east #China's Fujian Province, on June 2 saw the 1,000th China-Europe freight train trip since the city launched the service in 2015.  So far, its rail cargo service has linked the city with 30+ cities in 12 countries of #Europe and #CentralAsia.  
China has announced that it will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. As a good example of a #NetZero carbon community in China, Fuxing Village offers just a glimpse of what China is doing.  
In 2002, Michael Gordon cited unnamed & unverified sources from #CIA to claim #Iraq sought to develop Weapons of Mass Destruction. 17 yrs later, he once again cited #US intelligence report to fuel the lab-leak theory.  So familiar...  
#China’s #SinovacCoronaVac #vaccine has been given #WHO Emergency Use Listing on June 1. According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the easy storage requirements of CoronaVac make it very suitable for low-resource settings.  
As disclosed, the #US has spied on Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel by tapping into Danish internet cables and employed some 60K+ members of secret army. And as admitted by #WhiteHouse Press Secretary, its overseas surveillance is ongoing.    Now who is the thief?  
Yan'an, Yan'an. Though just left, already start to miss.  
Nangou village is located in An'sai, famous for waist drum. Once in poverty, now beautiful & rich  with agricultural development and #ecotourism. One creative way is to turn villagers into shareholders.  
The song #Nanniwan has been popular for nearly 80 years.  
In 1941, the 359 Brigade of the Eighth Route Army reclaimed wasteland to supply their own needs. The once barren #Nanniwan was transformed into a fertile place with thriving rice paddies more typical of south than north China.  
Amazing! The world's largest hammer-and-sickle statue in #Nanniwan, carved with the words from the #CommunistManifesto in German.  
They will be always remembered by the #Chinese people.
The 13 years in Yan'an from 1935 to 1948 witnessed the #CPC growing big from small, and strong from weak. During that period of time many journalists came to Yan'an and became the eyes of the world to know more about the CPC with their unbiased & objective reports.  
President Xi Jinping spent 7 years in #Liangjiahe village before he went to university. One of the biggest experience he learned there was to know how to respect & serve the people and always seek the truth from facts. These continue to benefit the #Chinese people today.  
Like #European #Renaissance, the 13 years of development of literature and arts in Yan'an from 1935 to 1948 inspired many #Chinese people and contributed greatly to China's revolution.  
By a stone table in Yangjialing, Yan'an in 1946, Mao Zedong made the assertion in a talk with American journalist Anna Louise Strong that "All reactionaries are #papertigers. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are powerful."  
"Upholding truth and correcting mistakes" was put forward at the Seventh National Congress of the #CPC in 1945. By adhering to this principle, the Party has achieved one success after another.  
At the #BaotaMountain. In 1937 when Chairman Mao and the #CPC Central Committee moved to Yan'an, the pagoda became the symbol of the sacred land of revolution. Resilience and perseverance of the Yan'an Spirit is carried on from generation to generation.  
In Luochuan on the way from Xi'an to Yan'an. The Luochuan Meeting in 1937 decided to set up base areas behind enemy lines, and form the anti-invasion United Front.  
Thanks to the unremitting efforts of Shi and his fellows, yellow turns green. The changes we see on the way from Xi'an to Yan'an are just part of those in #China.  
A story about Shi Guangyin, a hero of desert control in #China. Having moved seven times before 18, he made up his mind to reverse desertification by planting trees throughout his lifetime.   
The office of the 8th Route Army in #Xian. Starting from here, numerous patriotic youth and many foreign friends went to Yan'an in the 1930s and 1940s. We are embarking on the same journey to Yan'an. Fortunately, we won't have to spend 15 days on the way this time.  
State Councilor&FM Wang Yi is inviting foreign ministers from four #European countries to pay official visits to #China. They'll be in #Guiyang city, the hidden beauty of China in #Guizhou Province.

The #US-driven investigations" citing secret intelligence apparatus have notorious track records.  
When will the #US release detailed data and information on relevant cases?
Why does the #US keep silence on #FortDetrick and its 200+ bio-labs around the world? What's the connection between the unexplained outbreaks of respiratory disease in Northern Virginia in July 2019, the EVALI outbreaks in Wisconsin and #COVID19?
What they want is further stigmatization and political manipulation. Blame-shifting  will end up costing more lives and greater damage to global response to the Pandemic.
However, some in the #US keep turning a blind eye to facts, science and keep clamoring for additional investigation in #China. This shows that they don't care about facts or truth at all and have zero interest in serious science-based studies.  
The joint #WHO-#China study team has made authoritative official conclusions based on science. International experts on the joint team spoke highly of China's openness & transparency.
The plot of the so-called #Uyghur Tribunal in #UK was exposed by #Xinjiang offcials and a former trainee of the vocational education and training center at a Press Conference on Xinjiang-related issues. For more information👇

"It's an unchanging priority of China's diplomacy to enhance solidarity&cooperation with African countries. The foreign minister's first trip of every year takes him to Africa, kicking off China’s diplomatic agenda with friendship&trust."--State councilor&FM Wang Yi on Africa Day  
Yan'an: A "Lab of Democracy"- Gunther Stein Tells the Story of Beans #CPC100  
Agree wtih Professor Kishore Mahbubani. The west has no right to deprive the #Chinese people of the right to improve their standard of living.
We see #Europe as a partner, not a rival. We support the #EU in gaining greater unity, strength and strategic independence. We also stand ready to expand all-round cooperation with Europe on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit.
#China has joined almost all inter-governmental organizations and over 500 international treaties. We have never walked away from international obligations, never asked others to pick sides, or owed arrears to the #UnitedNations or any other international organization.
Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. To judge whether a country is truly practicing and upholding #multilateralism, one must look at what it is doing.
We must guard against “pseudo-multilateralism”. Sheer talk of returning to #multilateralism may hide a real scheme to form small circles and conduct group politics, and to even divide the world along ideological lines and force countries to pick sides.
The 193 #UN member states must not see themselves as 193 separate boats, but 193 sailors onboard the same boat. We must pull together in #solidarity, and heighten the awareness that we are a community with a shared future.
As countries differ in national realities, the practices of #democracy and human rights also vary from country to country. The key judgment is whether the people are satisfied and happy.
Some people have tried to portray #China’s relations with the West as a competition between #democracy and authoritarianism. Such an act of drawing lines between values is hardly objective, rational or democratic.
For #China, we have always been confident in our own system and inclusive toward other cultures. China will stick to the system and development path it has chosen and, at the same time, fully respect the independent choices of other countries.
Different social systems do not necessarily make countries rivals, nor do different development paths entail sure obstruction to mutually beneficial cooperation.
Countries differ in history, culture and social system, just like the food that is different in the #Chinese and Western cuisines that use either chopsticks or knife and fork — each is there for its own particular reason.
As for what system a country may adopt, there is no one-size-fits-all model.
#China's development has never been at the expense of other countries' interests; it has always focused on mutual benefit and cooperation. For over 10 years, China has contributed to more than 30 percent of global growth and more than 70 percent of global poverty reduction.
A #WorldBank report suggests that by 2030, globally, the #BeltandRoad Initiative could contribute to lifting 7.6 million people from extreme poverty and 32 million from moderate poverty.
In the face of mounting #protectionism, #China has hosted the #ChinaInternationalImportExpo for three years running to share its opportunities with the rest of the world.
#China has acted as a trustworthy partner of the international community.
#China is a fast-growing major country that is committed to #peacefulcoexistence with all countries and to non-hegemony, non-expansion and non-coercion. This is an irrefutable major contribution to global strategic stability.
In #China’s diplomatic vocabulary, there is no place for words like "coercion" or "bullying".
#China has a longer boundary, more neighboring countries, and more historical complications than any other country in the world. Through peaceful negotiations, China has delineated and demarcated boundaries with 12 of its 14 land neighbors.
For the last 70-plus years since the founding of the People’s Republic, #China has never started a war or encroached upon a single inch of foreign soil. China is the only country that has codified #peacefuldevelopment in its constitution.
For #China, the near completion of modernization, with its 1.4 billion people, is in itself a milestone in human development and, more importantly, a historic contribution to the progress of the world.
A right path was found to prosperity and strength, a path of #socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Finally, it was the #CPC that adapted #Marxism to the Chinese context and rallied and led the #Chinese people to achieve national independence and liberation.
Our forefathers explored and exhausted almost all political models available at the time, including #constitutionalmonarchy, #parliamentarism, multi-party system and #presidentialsystem, and yet all ended up in failure.
In modern times, the #Chinese nation was thrown almost to the brink of extinction as a result of aggression by #imperialism and #colonialism.
To understand #China's development, it is essential to have a good understanding of China's history and the #CPC. As an ancient nation with a 5,000-year civilization, China has had its glory days and been through trials and tribulations.
#China's development is for progress of humanity, not a challenge or threat to the world.
State councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is delivering video remarks at the China Edition of the #MunichSecurityConference.  
 
This #Canadian man found an interesting detail in his #Xinjiang tour.  
 
Tributes have flowed worldwide for #YuanLongping, the Chinese agronomist who made leading contributions to food security.  Tens of thousands of people across China lined up to lay flowers in memory of him. His legacy&mission will be carried on.  
The #FCO announced £8 million of new funding for #BBC World Service to challenge disinformation around the world. Shouldn't it immediately  stop deceiving &producing&spreading  lies& disinformation?!
"It's taken 25 years to get the truth. It raises the question in your mind, how many more cover-ups are there in the files of #BBC journalism that we haven't been told about."  
Former #BBC Chairman Lord Grade said the BBC's "cover-up" had been worse than Bashir's behaviour.
Unfortunately, lying&deceiving of this "independent and credible" media outlet is still going on. It owes apologies to #China too.  
"I am 107 years old and have never seen #justice" --in the #US.   
In #Pakistan, for example, a rice farmhouse in Lahore was carried out by Guard Agriculture Research and Services in collaboration with Chinese Yuan Longping High Tech Agriculture Company.  
A hybrid crop variety produced a harvest of 10.8 tonnes per hectare in #Madagascar, far exceeding the yield of local rice. The average yield of the hybrid rice planted in #Kenya is four to five times greater than conventional varieties.  
Since the 1980s, Yuan's team has offered training courses in dozens of countries in #Africa, the #Americas and #Asia -- providing a robust food source in areas with a high risk of famine.  
Known as "father of hybrid rice", Academician Yuan led China National Hybrid Rice R&D Center. He won the State Preeminent Science and Technology Award of #China in 2000 and Order of the Republic in 2019. Four asteroids and a college in China have been named after him.  
He has helped #China work a great wonder -- feeding nearly one-fifth of the world's population with less than 9 percent of the world's total land. And helped feeding the world's population.  
A super star&hero passed away today. Deepest condolences to #YuanLongping! Globally renowned agronomist&Father of hybrid rice!  
Working Together to Build a Global Community of Health for All  -- Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of China at the #GlobalHealthSummit

Nujiang prefecture, a southwest region known for the Nujiang river & Lisu ethnic group, has managed to lift its 550k residents out of poverty.  How has it been achieved? Foreign diplomats, government officials & local people are sharing their pespectives.   
"By smearing #China with one #Uygur issue after another, the #US & some allies are pinning themselves onto a history of infamy", wrote Syed Ali Nawaz Gilani, Secretary-General of #Pakistan China Friendship Association.  
A shopping mall in #Beijing shares the Martian perspective. Its #Mars-themed exhibitions attracts shoppers as #Tianwen1 successfully landed on the planet.  
#Shakespeare's Hamlet in #Tibetan language? Yes. This is what the Tiebtan students in #Shanghai Theatre Academy are doing now. They are trying hard to bring the Western classics to life in a different culture.  
Only 6 years after the #Guangdong-#HongKong-#Macao Greater Bay Area(#GBA) was initiated, the area achieved a GDP of 11.5 tln yuan ($1.8 tln) in 2020, a fundamental step for its goal-- developing into a world-class bay area by 2035.  
Congratulations and applause came worldwide for the successful landing of China's #Zhurongrover on the surface of #Mars.  
The #Palestinian question has always been the core of the #MiddleEast issue.  A ceasefire & cessation of violence is urgently needed. Something must be done to prevent the situation from further deteriorating & protect the lives of the people.

To discover the beauty of #Xinjiang, a themed film exhibition is on from May to July. Producers from a dozen countries will bring the audience Xinjiang's natural beauty, its authentic culture and people's life.  
How amazing is #Xinjiang? After sightseeing, two young visitors decided to stay and start up their B&B hotel in the ancient city of #Kashgar. Here's their venture stories.  
The unmitigated state power resting in the hands of white police officials in the #US reflected "a microcosm of that country's attitude towards other countries, that it exports war and misery in return for minerals".  
The #US hypocrisy and conspiracy of creating "#HumanRights issues" in #Xinjiang to mess up and contain #China have been seen through by more and more people, including our #African brothers.  
While countries are trying every means to get urgently needed vaccines, hundreds of millions of doses are sitting in warehouses in the #US.
Will the #US tell us has it provided any #vaccine to any country, including its allies? The US has 330m people, 4% of the world's population. However, it has purchased 2.6 bn vaccine doses, 1/4 of the world's total.  
The #US is particularly well versed in coercion. I wonder since when has US shifted from "#AmericaFirst" to "#Australia First"?  
The Security Council should honor its duty & take actions to uphold international peace&security, reaffirm commitment&support to the two-state solution, and restore peace on the ground immediately.
The #US claims that it cares about the #HumanRights of #Muslims. But it turns a blind eye to the sufferings of #Palestinian Muslims in recent clashes between #Israel and #Palestine.
Why #African countries support #China against the West on #HumanRights.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
In #Shaanxi, Xi’an, an expo titled "Silk Road on Fingertips" showcased more than 100 exquisite handicrafts made by women from #Turkey, #Iran, #SriLanka as well as #China. The #SilkRoad carries on trade, cultural&personnel exchanges among countries along the route.  
Indeed, as #HumanRights experts found out, "murder, severe deprivation of physical liberty, torture, persecution of people of African descent, & other inhuman acts" have occurred as part of a widespread or systematic attack against Black people in the #US.  
Family members of 165 victims of U.S. police brutality signed a letter sent to U.N. high commissioner for #HumanRights, calling for an "independent inquiry into the killings and violent law enforcement responses to protests in the #US."  
"Powerful, Different, Equal", the book written by Peter Walker, an expert on US-China relations&former senior partner at McKinsey&Co., was just released in Mandarin. First published in 2019, his work calls on US- China cooperation, yet fell on deaf ears among US mainstream media.  
Hope they will spend more time, energy and resources to ensure the rights and interests of their people, and to make greater contribution to the pandemic response efforts at home and abroad.
#US bases ring #China. There are no Chinese bases near America. Who exactly is taking increasingly more aggressive actions in the region?
Do #Japan, the #US & #France really think a joint military exercise could intimidate China? There are US aircraft and ships aggressively patrolling China’s borders, but no Chinese aircraft and ships off America’s coast.
The Security Council should reaffirm commitment&firm support to the two-state solution, work for deescalation and fulfill the obligations of upholding international peace&security.
We’re highly concerned about the escalating tensions between #Palestine and #Israel. #China condemns violence targeting civilians and call on parties to avoid further provocative rhetoric&acts.
We welcome all unbiased people to visit #Xinjiang. That said, we firmly reject so-called investigation with presumption of guilt by citing lies and rumors.
My question is, if someone makes an false accusation against you and arbitrarily asks you to open the door unconditionally so that they can rummage through your chests and cupboards, will you agree? This is not about facts, but sovereignty and dignity!  
Some people said,“If you have nothing to hide, why don’t you finally grant unimpeded access to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights?”
This further laid bare their intention to make an issue out of the human rights situation in Xinjiang to disrupt and contain China, and to divert people’s attention from their own past and on-going human rights crimes and incompetency in domestic governance and #COVID19 response.
They would rather play along with the clumsy show of a handful of anti-China forces than face up to the development and progress in #Xinjiang.  
Those Western countries would rather believe the lies concocted by a few people than heed the voice of the 25 million people of all ethnic groups in #Xinjiang and the 1.4 billion Chinese.  
... bring the perpetrators to justice and make deep apologies to the victims and victimized countries, and take prompt measures to ensure equitable distribution of #vaccines globally.
If they truly care about human rights, they should take effective measures immediately to make sure all ethnic minorities can breathe freely, stop killing innocent civilians in overseas military operations, ...
If they truly care about human rights, why are they so callous as millions die of #COVID19 at home?
If they truly care about human rights, why didn’t they invite residents from #Xinjiang to attend the event? If they truly care about human rights, why don’t they reflect upon and redress serious racial discriminatory polices and behavior at home?  
Instead of reflecting on their poor human rights records and crimes in the past and at present, the countries above crossed every line to smear and denigrate #China. This only exposes their sanctimonious hypocrisy.  
During #WWII, #NaziGermany slaughtered almost six million #Jews. Where is Germany’s concern for human rights?  
In the beginning of the 20th century, #German colonists slaughtered over 100,000 members of indigenous #Namibian tribes. United Nations Economic and Social Council Commission on Human Rights said in a report that this is the first #genocide in the 20th century.  
British forces killed innocent people and committed torture in places like #Iraq and #Afghanistan, but the culprits are sheltered by the government and stay beyond the law. Where is the #UK concern for human rights?
#Britain committed countless horrifying crimes all over the world during hundreds of years of colonial rule. The world’s first concentration camp in #SouthAfrica carries with it the disgraceful brand of the British Empire.  
The #US waged wars and military operations in #Iraq, #Libya, #Syria, #Afghanistan and other countries in the name of “fighting terrorism”, taking the lives of over a million #Muslims and displacing tens of millions. Where is the US concern for human rights?
However, it is exactly the #US and its accomplices that have killed the most #Muslims.
“Defined broadly enough, one could say that there’s systemic #racism across every institution in #America,” said Former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. The #US claims loudly enough that it is concerned about the human rights of #Muslims.
Former President Obama said, "the legacy of #discrimination in almost every institution of our lives — you know, that casts a long shadow. And that's still part of our DNA that's passed on”.  
In the #US today, racism is still a systemic and persistent existence penetrating every aspect of life.
Pulitzer Prize winner John Toland wrote in his book Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography that Hitler attributed his idea of concentration camps and his practice of genocide to his study of #British and #American history.  
An American historian at the University of Hawaii points out that the US warfare against the Native American population was the largest #genocide in history.
Between the mid-19th century and the 1970s, the #US government sent a large number of #Indian children to boarding schools, which can be called the progenitor of concentration camps.  
#US history has recorded the horrific systemic ethnic cleansing and slaughter of #NativeIndians, which constitute genocide and crimes against humanity.
The false allegations they launch against #China mirror their own historical crimes&sinister mentality.
The conference, awash with outrageous lies&disinformation, was another political farce. It was firmly rejected by the vast UN membership.
The #US, #UK & #Germany ganged up with some NGOs to host a virtual conference on #Xinjiang’s human rights situation based on lies&political prejudice falsely in the name of UN.  
 
 
The #Xinjiang #Muslims are celebrating Eid al-Fitr (also called Ruzi Festival) today.  
Based on the one-China principle, the Central Government of #China has made appropriate arrangements for #Taiwan's participation in global health affairs.  
The Central Government of #China takes all necessary measures to guarantee the health and welfare of our compatriots in #Taiwan.  
See how fluently these high school students in #China can speak English? What if vice versa?  
What have they done to promote the well-being of the Americans, protect their health, safeguard their human rights & improve social equality?
Those #US lawmakers elected by the American people, instead of focusing on solving problems at home, are keen to point fingers at #China every now and then. Do they really have no clue as to what real threat to the US is?
Republican congressmen proposed to set up 56 #FBI posts to supervise #Chinese students in American universities. Perhaps they should set up 300,000 FBI posts or at least 150,000 because there are more than 300,000 Chinese students in the US.
They want to create "forced industrial decoupling" & "forced unemployment" in #Xinjiang to serve their malicious agenda to disrupt Xinjiang and contain #China.
Xinjiang cotton is pure white and solar energy is clean, but those in the #US who hype up the issue have a dark and sinister intention.   
Hope those who made up "Chinese population crisis"  fallacy can live healthily and witness the realization of the #Chinesedream with the Chinese people together.
At every critical stage of #China's development, there have been various allegations including the "China threat theory" and "China collapse theory", which only turned out to be nothing but fallacies later on.
With socioeconomic development, especially changes of attitude towards childbearing due to industrialization & modernization, low fertility rate and aging of population has become a problem for most developed countries and a challenge to #China as well.
The #US population growth slowed in the past 10 years to its lowest rate since the 1930s. The number of births in the US in 2020 was down 4% from the previous year.
Still larger than the combined population of the #US and #European countries.
According to National Bureau of Statistics , #China's population now is 1.41178 bn, up 5.38% from 2020. Population of ethnic minority groups up 10.26%, while that of Han up 4.93%. China's population has maintained low growth for the past decade and remains the world's largest.
stick to opening-up & cooperation to build a corridor of connectivity for #Eurasia; join hands to build an anchor of regional stability; learn from each other through exchanges and jointly draw a new blueprint for high-quality development.
FM Wang Yi put forward 5-point proposal at the 2nd C+C5 foreign ministers meeting: work together to fight the #epidemic and build a community of health for all; forge ahead with innovation and jointly build the #SilkRoadEconomicBelt pilot zone;
Mike Ryan, executive director of the #WHO Health Emergencies Program made following remarks in response to the concern expressed by a journalist about the recent annual #Wuhan Strawberry Music Festival that attracted thousands of revelers:  
On May 12, 2008, #WenchuanEarthquake. On May 12, 2021, new cities rose from the ruins & its people emerged stronger. The children rescued from rubble grew up as firefighters, soldiers, medical workers to Wuhan & many more. 13yrs on, love & support persist.  
Lip service&empty gestures are equally useless. China has provided #vaccine assistance to +80 developing countries and exported doses to +50. We hope the US and other capable nations will race to provide more, better&affordable vaccines to developing countries in a timely manner.  
Our goal is to better ourselves, not overtake the US. Competition should be fair. Other countries’ right to development should be respected.
As a leading sporting nation, the US should understand the Olympic spirit of “faster, higher and stronger”. Athletes should try to outperform themselves rather than backstab others, otherwise will be sent off for breaking rules.
He was telling the truth. The US, rather than China, poses threats.   
If the US persists in confrontation, it will find itself increasingly isolated.  
Chas Freeman said in his article “Washington is playing a losing game with China”: There are US aircraft and ships aggressively patrolling China’s borders, but no Chinese aircraft and ships off America’s coast. US bases ring China. There are no Chinese bases near America.  
The US has expelled 60 Chinese journalists and limited visas for all Chinese journalists to a maximum 90-day stay. Meanwhile, the press credentials of most US media journalists in China are valid for one year.
It is fact-distorting to accuse China of suppressing foreign media and denying US journalists visa.
In the face of US abuse of discourse hegemony and disinformation attack, China of course needs to tell the world about truth and facts on important issues including COVID-19 so objective and right collective narrative could be passed on.
The world is diverse&colorful. CNN and BBC can’t represent all media. Each country should have its own voice. With 1/5 of world’s population, China deserves a place in the international media landscape.  
5 clothing and textile firms from #Xinjiang participated in the #CICPE held in #Haikou, demonstrating the entire industry chain from raw materials to finished garments. 600+ cotton flowers were packed in an exquisite way and dispatched to visitors as souvenirs.  
An opening #China expects that more people can come and see for themselves.  
Joerg Wuttke, President of #EU Chamber of Commerce in #China: Solving the poverty problem is a huge endeavor and a huge contribution to the world. The care for the Chinese people is the secret to the #CPC's success.  
According to #China's 7th #population census data, the population of Chinese mainland rose 72 mln. over the past decade to 1.41 bln. In 2020, the working age population is 880 mln. and the median age is 38.8 yrs.

Is this in line with democratic values? The truth is they are afraid to face the facts and truth.
Some in the #US buy the "account" of the few false witnesses and experts, but refuse to listen to the voices far outnumbering those of false actors, and heed the call of 1.4 billion #Chinese people, including over 25 million people of all ethnic groups in #Xinjiang.
The #US killed #Muslims more than any other country in the world. As it waged wars and carried out military operations in the name of "counterterrorism" in 80-plus countries, leading to 800,000+ deaths and tens of millions displaced in #Afghanistan, #Iraq and #Syria.  
Why doesn't the #US respect and tolerate other civilizations and systems? Why target and suppress views different from its "political correctness"? Why deprive other countries of the right and freedom to better development ?
If the #US truly defends freedom, why won't they allow others to tell the truth when they are making up lies? Why has Mr. #Assange been thrown in prison after being forced to shelter in the #Ecuadorian Embassy in London for 7 years?  
#US website Counterpunch's article also said US interest in the fate of #Uyghurs is motivated by geopolitics rather than care for #HumanRights. This view is widely shared.  
#Sweden-based TFF stressed "report" on genocide in #Xinjiang lacks credibility and the relevant #US think tank has obvious political aims.  
#China has offered #vaccine assistance to 80-plus developing countries&vaccine exports to 50-plus countries. We hope capable countries can take speedy actions to provide more vaccines to developing countries and promote equitable distribution and use of vaccines across the world.
But when it comes to #China, the tune is completely different. Some people may be forgetful, but the Internet has a long memory. No #DoubleStandard.
There's no surface damage reported for #China's rocket. Burning rocket remnants of #US rocket crashing on a farm in March were described by some US media as "leaving comet-like trails" .
#China will work with #Russia and others to defend the victory of WWII & hard-won peace, and safeguard the #UN-centered international system.
Congratulations to #Russia for the successful grand military parade to commemorate the 76th anniversary of Soviet victory in the Great Patriotic War. @mfa_russia
On May 12 the 2nd C+C5 foreign ministers' meeting will be held in Xi'an, cradle of the ancient Silk Road. #CentralAsia was an important node on the ancient Silk Road. Also, Pres. Xi Jinping first proposed SREB there. Hope the meeting will deliver new outcomes in #BRI cooperation.
China is set to launch a special exhibition to display a cluster of precious collections from the museums and art institutions across the country in celebration of the #InternationalMuseumDay on May 18.  
As a tradition, girls from the Miao ethnic group in southwest China learn from their mother and grandmother how to dye their clothes at an early age. This fascinating handicraft, while attracting more people, is creating many job opportunities.

The Emperor and Empress Pay Respect for #Buddha is a national treasure of great historical and cultural values. In the 1930s, it was stolen and taken abroad in pieces. With live performance, actors and actresses bring the relief from the Northern Wei Dynasty back to life.  
After years of protection and conservation efforts, Tibetan #antelope, China’s first-class protected species, has seen its population grow to 300,000+. Every year in May, pregnant females migrate to Zonag Lake in Hoh Xil , northwest China’s Qinghai Province to give birth.  
In 2020, these foreign youths explored history & culture, visited cities & enterprises across #China, and were thrilled by the country’s vibrancy and diversity.  
We should respect #diversity instead of seeking one’s own supremacy. The diversity of countries, together with the common values of #peace, #development, #equity, #justice, #democracy and #freedom, will unleash the great power of #multilateralism.
We should focus on action rather than rhetoric. We must act in the common interests of all, and bear in mind every country will benefit from what is best for the world. Our actions should serve long-term needs. Major countries must lead by example to provide global public goods.
We should pursue #equity and #justice, not bullying or hegemony. International rules must be based on international law, and must be written by all. They must be applicable to all countries, and there should be no room for exceptionalism or double standards.
We should engage in win-win cooperation, not zero-sum games. What is needed is dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect among all countries. Countries must work together to ensure all come out as winners and to achieve security and prosperity for all.  
Having visited almost 20 provinces in China, #Colombian Ambassador to China Luis Diego Monsalve said many once underdeveloped regions in China are catching up quickly. #China benefited from #globalization and will continue to open wider to the world.

Tourism delights visitors and alleviates #poverty. A photo exhibition entitled "Cases of Poverty Alleviation through Tourism in China" opened in #Sofia on May 5th and shares 14 stories of #Tibet and #Qinghai.
There are 55 ethnic minorities in #China, WHY does the US only "care about" Uyghurs in #Xinjiang? The #US is afraid of the truth and won't respect and listen to the voices of the 1.4 billion Chinese including the 2.5 million people in Xinjiang.  
WHY none of the 55 Muslim countries in the world follow the #US in accusing #China of persecuting Muslims? If the US genuinely cares about Muslims,WHY is it doing nothing to help the US Muslims out of  racial discrimination?
The #US is the country that killed the largest number of Muslims in the world. WHY is it now so obsessed with "caring about" Muslims in #China, instead of the tens of thousands of Muslims it killed in #Iraq, #Syria and #Afghanistan?
Member of the #EuropeanParliament, Mick Wallace:"Why are we choosing an aggressive position with #China?" "In the last 40 years, China bombed nobody or isn't sanctioning any countries to death-Why is #EU allowing #US to drag us into confrontation with China?"
 
The world needs genuine #multilateralism. All countries should act in line with the purposes&principles of the #UNCharter, refrain from pursuing #unilateralism &hegemonism, and should not use multilateralism as a pretext to form small circles or stir up ideological confrontation.

"It was like trying to count stars in the #MilkyWay", said scientists who counted a staggering 27,000+ barrels & 100,000+ debris objects in DDT dumpsite off the coast of #LosAngeles. Is this the #American way of environmental protection?  
Think tank's report exposes Western lies on #Xinjiang  
But if anyone undermines our #nationalsovereignty & dignity, we surely won't fail to respond.
Unlike the #US, #China never resorts to threat of force, military alliance or export of ideology. We don't provoke trouble on others' doorsteps or meddle in their domestic affairs. We've never started a trade war or wantonly suppressed foreign companies.
The #US goes all out to pressure #China, illegally detaining Chinese citizens, wantonly interfering in our internal affairs concerning #HongKong & #Xinjiang, and luring or coercing others into forming an anti-China clique. China is a victim of #coercivediplomacy.
To retain its monopoly in science & technology, the #US abuses the concept of #nationalsecurity to wantonly suppress foreign high-tech companies, even coercing others into joining it.
The #US has long been wielding the big stick of sanctions against #Cuba, the #DPRK, #Iran & #Venezuela. NSA Jake Sullivan once wrote that the previous administration's Iran policy "is all coercion & no diplomacy".
The #US government referred to its overthrow of the Haitian junta in 1994 as "a textbook example of #coercivediplomacy". In 2003, it earmarked $30.3 billion as additional military expenses for coercive diplomacy.
In 1971, #StanfordUniversity Professor Alexander George coined this concept to summarize then #US policy on #Laos, #Cuba & #Vietnam. Since then, the US has shown the world with threat of force, political isolation, economic sanctions & technology blockade.
No one deserves the title "master of #coercivediplomacy" more than the #US.
The pursuit of happiness is not a prerogative of the American people alone. Attempt by the #US to deprive the 1.4 billion #Chinese people of their right to a better life is also violation of human rights itself.
Picturesque #Guangxi.

Drawing on History and Looking to the Future to Advance #China-#US Relations along the Right Track--by Director Yang Jiechi  
▶Sixth, selective reporting.  The report is widely covered by Western mainstream media, who turned a blind eye to its many loopholes. A typical example of the Military-Industrial-Media-Academic Complex at work.
▶Fifth, double standard.  The report treats #China as the subject of all evil, including its effective counter-terrorism efforts in #Xinjiang, but dismisses the human costs of US-led Global War On Terror.
▶Fourth, inconsistency with values.  The report promotes a confrontational policy on #China. It does not conform to the ideal of mutual understanding & peace held by the Newlines Institute.
▶Third, lack of academic integrity.  The report contains both fake, dubious & biased choices of sources. It also deliberately left out important perspectives, theories & facts.
▶Second, suspicious timing.  The report may have been published to back up Pompeo's genocide determination in #Xinjiang. No evidence accompanied it.
▶First, lack of independence.  The report reflects Christian fundamentalism, hawkish conservative #US foreign policy & extreme anti-Communism machinery.
Take a look at this TFF analysis & find out why the report alleging genocide in #Xinjiang by Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy is problematic.

#China Is Where I Wanted to Stay Forever — The Paper Tiger Lady's Six Visits to China #100CPCStories  
Full Text: Remarks by Chinese President Xi Jinping at Leaders Summit on Climate.  
Yet I am confident that as long as we unite in our purposes and efforts and work together with #solidarity and mutual assistance, we will rise above the global climate and environment challenges and leave a clean and beautiful world to future generations.
#Climatechange poses pressing, formidable and long-term challenges to us all.
A number of green action initiatives have been launched, covering wide-ranging efforts in green infrastructure, green energy, green transport and green finance, to bring enduring benefits to the people of all #BeltandRoad partner countries.
#China has also made ecological cooperation a key part of #BeltandRoad cooperation.
From remote sensing satellites for climate monitoring in #Africa to low-carbon demonstration zones in Southeast Asia and to energy-efficient lights in small island countries, such cooperation has yielded real, tangible and solid results.
#China has done its best to help developing countries build capacity against #climatechange through various forms of results-oriented South-South cooperation.
#China will host #COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity this October.
As a participant, contributor and trailblazer in global ecological conservation, #China is firmly committed to putting #multilateralism into action and promoting a fair and equitable system of global environmental governance for #winwin cooperation.
#China's national #carbonmarket will also start trading.
#China will strictly control coal-fired power generation projects, and strictly limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th #FiveYearPlan period and phase it down in the 15th Five-Year Plan period.
We are now making an action plan and are already taking strong nationwide actions toward #carbonpeak. Support is being given to peaking pioneers from localities, sectors and companies.
The targets of #carbonpeak and #carbonneutrality have been added to #China's overall plan for ecological conservation.
#China has committed to move from carbon peak to #carbonneutrality in a much shorter time span than what might take many developed countries, and that requires extraordinarily hard efforts from China.
This major strategic decision is made based on our sense of responsibility to build a community with a shared future for mankind and our own need to secure #sustainabledevelopment.
#China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve #carbonneutrality before 2060.
We will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to #development.
Ecological advancement and conservation have been written into #China's #Constitution.
…and refrain from creating green trade barriers, so as to help developing countries accelerate the transition to green and low-carbon #development.
Developed countries need to increase climate ambition and action. At the same time, they need to make concrete efforts to help developing countries strengthen the capacity and resilience against #climatechange, support them in financing, technology, and capacity building,
We need to give full recognition to developing countries' contribution to climate action and accommodate their particular difficulties and concerns.
The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities is the cornerstone of global climate governance. Developing countries now face multiple challenges to combat #COVID19, grow the economy, and address #climatechange.
We must be committed to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.
#China looks forward to working with the international community including the #UnitedStates to jointly advance global #environmentalgovernance.
#China welcomes the #UnitedStates'return to the multilateral climate governance process.
We must join hands, not point fingers at each other; we must maintain continuity, not reverse course easily; and we must honor commitments, not go back on promises.
We need to uphold the UN-centered international system, comply with the objectives and principles laid out in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (#UNFCCC) and its #ParisAgreement.
We need to work on the basis of international law, follow the principle of #equity and #justice, and focus on effective actions.
We need to look for ways to protect the #environment, grow the economy, create jobs and remove poverty all at the same time, so as to deliver social #equity and #justice in the course of green transition and increase people's sense of benefit, happiness and security.
We need to properly balance all elements and aspects of #Nature. This is a way that may take us where we want to be, an #ecosystem in sound circulation and overall balance.
We must be committed to systemic governance. Protecting the #ecosystem requires more than a simplistic, palliative approach.
We need to make sure that a sound #environment is there to buttress sustainable economic and social #development worldwide.
We must abandon development models that harm or undermine the #environment, and must say no to shortsighted approaches of going after near-term development gains at the expense of the environment.
Green mountains are gold mountains. To protect the #environment is to protect productivity, and to improve the environment is to boost productivity.
We should protect #Nature and preserve the environment like we protect our eyes, and endeavor to foster a new relationship where man and Nature can both prosper and live in harmony.
Failure to respect #Nature or follow its laws will only invite its revenge. Systemic spoil of Nature will take away the foundation of human survival and #development, and will leave us human beings like a river without a source and a tree without its roots.
We must be committed to harmony between man and #Nature. We must treat Nature as our root, respect it, protect it, and follow its laws.
Faced with unprecedented challenges in global environmental governance, the international community needs to come up with unprecedented ambition and action to foster a community of life for man and Nature.
#Climatechange has posed severe challenges to human survival and development.
For Man and Nature: Building a Community of Life Together — President Xi Jinping delivered remarks at the #LeadersSummit on Climate.
It's been 58 years since Martin Luther King Jr. cried out  "#IHaveADream". Hopefully, this time African&Asian Americans won't have to wait too long to enjoy the right to breathe freely& be free from fear of killing and discrimination.
This is another example that proves some in Australia have ZERO sincerity in improving relations with China. The Australian side should shake off the #ColdWarMentality&ideological bias.
Did FM Marise Payne fully consult with the Australian people, esp. those in Victoria before announcing the decision to cancel Victoria's #BRI agreement with China? Has she considered what this could cost them?

Really stunning report. And it was from a #UK government commission:  
OHCHR of the #UN: In 2021, it is stunning to read a report on race and ethnicity that repackages racist tropes and stereotypes into fact, twisting data and misapplying statistics and studies into conclusory findings and ad hominem attacks on people of #African descent.  
As legislators elected by the #American people, what have you done to ensure the #HumanRights & justice of your constituencies? In #China including #HongKong, people are enjoying unprecedented safety, rights & freedom. Mind your own business!
@SpeakerPelosi & #HouseOfRepresentatives Where's the #HumanRights of the 500k+lives lost to #COVID19? Where's the human rights of the 50k+victims of gun violence since last year? Where's the justice for #Asian, #AfricanAmericans& other minorities suffering racial discrimination?

China is“far more humanistic than the United States ever was”--YanisVaroufakis，former Finance Minister of Greece   
China supports Saudi Arabia's initiative to promote global climate governance. Together, we will follow the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, promote  full&effective implementation of Paris Agreement for a fair, reasonable&win-win climate governance system.
In a phone call with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, President Xi Jinping said that #China&Saudi Arabia are comprehensive strategic partners& will carry out all-round high-level cooperation in energy, trade&high-tech.
In a phone call with President Joko Widodo, President Xi said that #China&Indonesia will promote practical cooperation across board. In addition to #vaccine cooperation, we will also uphold #multilateralism, fairness&justice to safeguard common interests of developing countries.
What the #US gov has been doing to #Xinjiang actually constitutes violations of human rights, including rights to development&work of people in Xinjiang particularly  the #Uyghurs. This is another form of racial discrimination.
If #Uyghurs making clothing&cars is "forced labor", then who should engage in this kind of job without being called “forced labor”?
Some accuse #Xinjiang of "forced labour" as many #Uyghurs work in low-skilled, labour-intensive sectors like clothing&cars. But if Uyghurs learning  Mandarin #Chinese could cause "genocide", how do they get knowledge&skills required by high-tech sector?

Strong economic comeback! The #GDP of #Hubei Province surged by nearly 60% in Q1 2021. Swift and effective #COVID19 response helped to bring life back to normal and unleash consumer spending.  
Full Text: Keynote speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the opening ceremony of the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021.  
#China will take an active part in multilateral #cooperation on trade and investment and develop new systems for a higher-standard #openeconomy. All are welcome to share in the vast opportunities of the Chinese market.  
However strong it may grow, #China will never seek hegemony, expansion, or a sphere of influence. Nor will China ever engage in an arms race.  
We will act in the spirit of #openness and #inclusiveness as we work with all willing participants to build the #BRI into a pathway to #povertyalleviation and growth.  
A World Bank report suggests that by 2030, #BeltandRoad projects could help lift 7.6 million people from extreme poverty and 32 million people from moderate poverty across the world.
We will build a closer partnership for health #cooperation, a closer partnership for connectivity, a closer partnership for green development and a closer partnership for #openness and #inclusiveness.
We will follow the principles of extensive #consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and champion the philosophy of #open, green and clean #cooperation, in a bid to make Belt and Road cooperation (#BRI) high-standard, people-centered and sustainable.
Belt and Road cooperation (#BRI) pursues #development, aims at mutual benefits, and conveys a message of hope. We will continue to work with other parties in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.  
The Belt and Road Initiative (#BRI) is a public road open to all, not a private path owned by one single party. All interested countries are welcome aboard to take part in the cooperation and share in its benefits.  
Once the #pandemic gets under control, #China will host the second Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations as part of our active efforts to promote inter-civilization dialogue in #Asia and beyond.
We must advocate #peace, #development, #equity, #justice, #democracy and #freedom, which are common values of humanity, and encourage exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations to promote the progress of human civilization.  
Bossing others around or meddling in others' internal affairs would not get one any support.
We need commitment to justice to create a future of mutual respect and mutual learning. In state-to-state relations, the principles of #equality, mutual respect and mutual trust must be put front and center.
We need to advance international #cooperation on #climatechange. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be upheld, and concerns of developing countries on capital, technology and capacity building must be addressed.
It is important that we bolster international #cooperation on the R&D, production and distribution of #vaccines so that everyone in the world can access and afford the vaccines they need.  
We must put people and their lives above anything else, scale up information sharing and collective efforts, enhance public health and medical #cooperation.
We need #solidarity and #cooperation to create a future of health and security.
In this age of #economicglobalization, #openness and integration is an unstoppable historical trend. Attempts to "erect walls" or "decouple" run counter to the law of economics and market principles. They would hurt others' interests without benefiting oneself.
We need #openness and #innovation to create a future of #development and #prosperity.  
What we need in today's world is #justice, not hegemony. Big countries should behave in a manner befitting their status and with a greater sense of responsibility.  
We must not let the rules set by one or a few countries be imposed on others, or allow #unilateralism pursued by certain countries to set the pace for the whole world.
World affairs should be handled through extensive #consultation, and the future of the world should be decided by all countries working together.  
We need to follow the principles of extensive #consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, uphold true #multilateralism, and make the #globalgovernance system more fair and equitable.
#Globalgovernance should reflect the evolving political and economic landscape in the world, conform to the historical trend of #peace, #development and #winwincooperation, and meet the practical needs in addressing global challenges.
We need #consultation on an equal footing to create a future of shared benefits.  
#China calls on all countries in #Asia and beyond to answer the call of our times, defeat the #pandemic through #solidarity, strengthen global governance, and keep pursuing a community with a shared future for mankind. #communitywithasharedfutureformankind
Where should humanity go from here? What kind of future should we create for future generations? As we try to answer these important questions, it is crucial that we bear in mind the shared interests of mankind and make responsible and wise choices.
While we live in an age rife with challenges, it is also an age full of hope.
This Forum has borne witness to the extraordinary journey of #China, of #Asia and of the world, and has exerted a significant influence in boosting development in Asia and beyond.  
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the #BoaoForum. Asia has become the most vibrant and promising region in the global economy.

As President Xi Jinping's special envoy, State Councilor&FM Wang Yi attended and addressed the #UN Security Council high-level open debate on enhancing cooperation between the UN and regional and sub-regional organizations on April 19.  
According to CNN, #US has seen at least 147 mass shootings so far in 2021. Stunning, right? Sad, right? Outrageous, right?  
Is #Japan trying to produce "Godzillas" by discharging #Fukushima nuclear contaminated water into the #Pacific?
What did the #US do to protect the #HumanRights of the 500,000+ died from #COVID19 and 41,500 killed in gun violence every year?
#Japan's war of aggression in 1930s brought untold sufferings to people in #China and #Asia. #US waged wars that took over 800,000 lives, including 300,000+ civilians.
While trumpeting "free&open", #US and #Japan are acting to form "small cliques" for bloc confrontation, which poses real threats to regional peace, stability and  damage to international rules and order.
There's only one system in the world, i.e. the international system with the #UN as its core. #US and #Japan cannot represent the international community and have no right to define international order.
"So What's wrong with that?"
"This is a brutalist philosophy." "Even if #China were to change..., adopted our constitution and our laws... We should still try to limit their growth, merely because we shouldn't have a peer competitor. " "That is the proposition regardless of beliefs..."  
#HillaryClinton, former State Secretary of the #US, exposed that the US funded, trained, equipped the terrorists in Central Asia some 20yrs ago.  The same things are still going on.  
Some designated by #US as associated with terrorism have not been charged with any crimes, but are coerced into carry out tasks against their will. This amounts to forced labour as defined by the ILO. US should examine its serious #humanrights problems and fix them.  
Take a look at modern agriculture in #Xinjiang.

#Xinjiang: what the West doesn't tell you about China's war on terror  
We hope the #US will find its right place, come back to compliance with international law & #multilateralism.
According to provisions of the UNFCCC, the US should take steps to limit greenhouse gas emissions and take the lead in fulfilling reductions obligations.  
It is still yet to present its NDCs and offer how it will make up for the lost four years, and has not cleared its long-overdue payment to the Green Climate Fund.
It is the US that announced exit from the Paris Agreement in 2017, stopped implementing its NDCs, and impeded global efforts to achieve goals of the Agreement. Its return is by no means a glorious comeback but rather a truant getting back to class.
A US State Department spokesperson said China "is not yet on a path that will allow the world to meet the Paris Agreement's goal...We must insist Beijing do more to reduce emissions."
President Xi just had a video conference with French President Macron and German Chancellor Merkel.  
 
US announced new sanctions on Russia. Wanton use or threat of use of unilateral sanctions in international relations is nothing but power politics&bullying. China firmly rejects such behavior.
The documentary tells the story about dozens of ordinary residents in the region. Their gender, ethnicity, age and hometown are not the same, but they share the same deep love for Xinjiang, the land they all call home.
"Beyond the Mountains: Life in Xinjiang" not only shows the striking beauty of Xinjiang's culture and natural landscape, but also profiles a region different from how it appears through Western media lenses.  
Leading The Global Race To Zero Emissions：A New #China-#US Climate Agenda --SIIS scholars' report  
But don't forget #China has never waged a war; the #US waged wars and conducted military operations in around 80 countries since 2001.
To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. The #US wants to maintain its global hegemony forever, so it sees challenges and threats everywhere.  
Violators of international treaties and human conscience must be investigated and convicted. What right do they have to lecture others on #HumanRights?
Some western powers have committed serious #HumanRights abuses in #Afghanistan and #Iraq, including mistreatment and killing of civilians.  
#China will make the stride from carbon peaking to carbon neutrality within 30 years, which usually takes 50 to 60 years in developed countries. This commitment in itself demonstrates China's responsibility.
This time, the trick backfires.  
Yes, #Olympic spirit will surely be our strong ties. And we're also looking forward to the Year of Culture&Tourism.
#Greek Ambassador to #China Georgios Iliopoulos: As China is to host #BeijingOlympics2022 Winter Games, China&Greece will build up even more common understandings.  
My loyalty,first and foremost,was as a #Chinese person. I never changed.  
#NED twittered that they have funded separatist forces in #Xinjiang since 2004.  All these reveal the truth about Xinjiang and the untold evilness of the #US to make use of Xinjiang people to contain #China.  
···to foment unrest and to join with those #Uyghurs in pushing the Han Chinese in #Beijing from internal places rather than external".
Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to then Secretary of State Colin Powell said that "The #CIA would want to destabilize #China and that would be the best way to do it,···  
That's not within our interest area, unless it can be utilized, capitalized upon to get our objective".
Sibel Edmonds, a former #FBI translator, said that "We want to...play the minority without land (in #Xinjiang)...the #Chinese are gunning them down and torturing them...we put a military base there"; "We never cared about people...  
The #PacificOcean belongs to all pacific countries.  #Japan did great harm to its neighbors in the past. It should fulfill its responsibilities instead of bring new harm to its neighbours.
Endorsement(secret deal?) by the #US does not mean endorsement by the international community.
#Japan is also obliged to undertake such international obligations as notification & full consultation, environmental assessment & monitoring, preventive measures to minimize risks, and information transparency.
···where they exercise sovereign rights in accordance with the Convention”.
#Japan is a party to #UNCLOS and should be aware of the provision that "States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that pollution arising from incidents or activities under their jurisdiction or control does not spread beyond the areas···
#China, #ROK, #Russia, #EU and 311 environmental groups expressed firm opposition.
#Japan Fisheries Association called the decision a heavy blow to the industry and absolutely unacceptable. Protests took place across Japan with posters reading "Oceans are weeping; Fishes are weeping; Earth is weeping".
The #US thanked #Japan for its "transparent efforts". But early in March, #FDA issued the import alert. Any secret deal behind?  
#China has paid in full its assessed contributions for 2021. We support #UN & #multilateralism with deeds. All UN  member states have the responsibility and obligation to pay their assessments in full, on time and without conditions. The #US in particular should take the lead.  
Who on earth made Blood Cotton?  
Good news. China's foreign trade volume was up 29.2% in Q1 2021. The economy is gaining momentum amid #COVID19, and #China is ready to contribute more to world economic recovery and development.  
Of course better have international assessment before they drink.
#Japan and the #US claim that the treated nuclear waster water from the #Fukushima nuclear power plant is in accordance with international safety standards and even drinkable, then why don't they keep the water for themselves? or maybe ship it to the US？  
Just came across this dialogue in 2015 between then #DPM Tharman Shanmugaratnam of #Singapore and #BBC. Still inspiring. We all need some humility on the ways to advance liberty and to sustain it.  
State Councilor&FM Wang Yi signed this pretty souvenir envelope for the Special Event of MFA presenting #Hubei to the world. On it, you can find a "hand-in-hand" commemorative postmark. It also features a panoramic view of #Wuhan city, a high-speed train & the Three Gorges Dam.  
We have supported over 500 projects in areas of education, health, women & poverty reduction and delivered real benefits. China will work with Mekong countries to carry forward Lancang-Mekong spirit, maintain Lancang-Mekong speed and advance Lancang-Mekong cooperation.  
#China and #Mekong countries are close friendly neighbors and natural cooperation partners. Over the past 5 years, our cooperation on connectivity, production capacity and agriculture has achieved tangible results.  
On April 13, FM Wang Yi attended a reception marking the 5th anniversary of the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation and sent wishes to #Mekong countries for the water festival.  
▪If the US is bent on repeating lies 1,000 times, we will reiterate the truth 10,000 times. Facts and truth about #Xinjiang stay unshakable like the mountain of Tianshan and clear like the lake of Tianchi. Prosperity, stability and ethnic harmony in Xinjiang are the best answer.
▪Since 2001, #US has launched military operations in around 80 countries in the name of fighting terrorism, leading to 800,000 deaths. Why does the US “worry itself sick” over Muslims in #Xinjiang only?
▪The US has been repeating lies of “genocide” in Xinjiang. It only reveals its three-fold conspiracy: contain China & hold back China’s development by disrupting #Xinjiang; sow discord between China & Muslim countries; cover up its deplorable record on the treatment of Muslims.
It is Canada which has arbitrarily detained Ms. Meng Wanzhou for 864 days. She should be released immediately.
In 2019,  200mil home&overseas tourists visited #Xinjiang. In 2020, the number was 158mil despite the #COVID19 pandemic, 4 times the population of Canada. China, including Xinjiang, is now the safest place in the world.
 
 
Even its own people are saying NO!  #Japanese protested against the government's decision to discharge nuclear wastewater into the sea, since it "will have serious, long-term consequences for communities & the environment, locally & much further afield".  
#Japan should take its due responsibilities for the interests of its own people, its future generations and its neighboring countries.
 
The #Fukushima nuclear accident, like the Chernobyl disaster, is one of the most serious in world history.  
Have a look:  
Take a look at today's Hubei and #Wuhan, one will understand #China has done whatever she needed to do and whatever could be done. But how about the #US? Did the US gov do what it needed to do?  
#Wuhan in numbers:  
Heroic Hubei, Beautiful Province.  
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered remarks at the Special Event of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs presenting #Hubei Province.  
This is #Hubei. This is #Wuhan. This is how we went through the year fighting #COVID19.   
Pictures in Landing this afternoon.  
"Heroic #Hubei: Reborn for New Glories" Special Promotion Event is now on in Lanting, MFA.  State Councilor&FM Wang Yi addressed the event.  
As we will soon meet in Lanting, MFA this afternoon for "Heroic Hubei: Reborn for New Glories" Special Promotion Event, let's have a review of the year #China fighting against #COVID19 through #Xinhua pictures:  
All #Chinese rooted for #Wuhan, Hubei, during the difficult time. Now, the "hot dry noodles" has fully recovered and is ready to meet the world in Lanting, MFA.  
Correction: Takeuchi Ryo
People of nearby region, even in #Japan itself, have spoken out their serious concerns. And we have made our position so clear:  
The #CPC and the #Chinese government have always put the Chinese people front and center, fully committed to serving the people. People's contentment and happiness are the most important measurement. That is why #China can reach where it is today.
This time #BBC puts something new on its #Chinese version.  Indeed,The Chinese people, back to millennia ago, already understood that the water to boat is people to their government. That is why they observed, "the water can carry the boat or sink it."  
A former #FBI staff exposed as early as in 2015 how the #US planned to use #Xinjiang against #China.  
Takuechi Ryo, the well-known #Japanese director who brought the true story of #Wuhan to the world, has come back to the city with his wife one year later. First, tried Reganmian, the signature noodles.  And his trip is all the way live on #Chinese social media.  
Amazing #space images.  And They are #embroidery artworks! 26 pieces in 18 years, with some 10 stitching skills, 4k+ colours & silk threads as subtle as splitted into 1/64, this young lady brought a miracle to the world.  
10,000 #ChineseSturgeon, known as the "panda in the water," were just released into #Yangtze River and will be tracked through a variety of tagging methods, including placed vivo device chips.  Another effort for a better aquatic life in the River.  
 
 
 
 
 
#China has accumulated valuable experiences and offers enlightenment to the international community in the battle to reduce #poverty:  
...is a milestone in the history of the #Chinese nation and the history of humankind, making an important contribution to the cause of global #PovertyAlleviation.
#China is home to nearly one fifth of the world's population. Its complete eradication of extreme poverty – the first target of the #UN 2030 Agenda for #SustainableDevelopment – 10 years ahead of schedule,...  
Malcolm Clarke, the British Director, just released his new film in Shanghai. Actually we got to know him from  BETTER ANGELS, his feature documentary in 2018.  Trying to build a bridge between China & the West, he has tried hard to show the true colors of China & Chinese people.  
It's been a year since Wuhan's lockdown was lifted. #Wuhan being one of the safest cities in the world is the best rebuttal to smears&rumors, and the reason why some foreigners regretted leaving Wuhan. Big thanks to every medical worker, every heroic citizen in this heroic city!
Watch out when you throw a stone up in the air, or it will come down and hit your head. 向上抛石头，留心自己头。
#CNN staff: When it comes to the framing of #China, we’re going to use all the rhetoric we have to make China look like the bad guys on the world stage. Heard of a #Uyghur idiom?  
See? Some re-telling stories by some people working with some US-backed fake NGOs, institutions and so on, under the cover of “human rights”.  And some “mainstream”media keep blind and silent on this.
This report, as early as February, disclosed how those Hitlerian “big lies”on #Xinjiang was made.   
For more truths about the so-called “witnesses” and their “testimonies” about #Xinjiang, check out the following links:  
 
The "Uyghur Transitional Justice Database", founded by head of the Norwegian Uyghur Committee that belongs to the World Uyghur Congress, listed photos and videos of "witnesses", claiming that some of them are missing or imprisoned. Check out the truth about their happy life.
Mirigul Tursun told CNN her "terrible experiences" in the "camp", but what's her true story? Please watch this video clip.  
Tursunay Ziawudun told her "experiences" to BBC, claiming that women suffered from "systemic rape" and "forced sterilisation" in #Xinjiang "concentration camps". Watch this video to check out the reality.  
Sayragul Sauytbay, the "International Women of Courage Awards"recipient presented by Mike Pompeo, claimed that she received mistreatment in the "concentration camp". Watch this video to find out the truth.   
The friendly bond between the peoples can never be severed by politics. Countries with different history&social systems can conduct friendly exchanges and cooperation on the basis of mutual respect.  
50 yrs ago today, "ping-pong diplomacy"opened a new chapter of friendly exchanges between Chinese&American people.
The US should return to the deal unconditionally and lift all relevant sanctions at an early date, including long-arm jurisdictions over a third party. On this basis, Iran should resume compliance reciprocally.
The former US administration withdrew from the JCPOA and exerted maximum pressure on Iran. This is the root cause of the persistent tension of the Iranian nuclear situation.
Despite blockade, China's supercomputing is leading the world. The US containment and suppression won't stop China's progress in S&T.
China firmly rejects the US'adding of 7 Chinese supercomputing entities to the Entity List. The move is an abuse of national security concept&state power, in order to maintain monopoly and hegemony in S&T sector.  
See how senior CIA officer Graham Fuller wrote about the potential to spark the radicalisation of Uyghur separatists in #Xinjiang "to counter China's influence in Central Asia".  
Why #Xinjiang got so hot? Because some  are playing the "Uyghur card" to put pressure on China. And CIA is definitely the 1st in the line.  
Why does the #US build so many bio-labs all over the world? Do the labs conform with safety standards? Are there any risks? The world needs an answer.
It is a question. Indeed, the international community has repeatedly expressed concern to #US bio-labs in other countries. Such activities are not transparent, safe or justified.   
As of today last year, #Wuhan, the city fighting against #COVID19, reopened from its 76-days lockdown. Now it fully blooms with its well-known cherry blossoms.  And on Apr. 12, the Foreign Ministry will hold the Special Promotion Event for "Heroic #Hubei: Reborn for New Glories".  
Since the 13th Five-Year-Plan period (2016-2020), more than 9.6 million people from inhospitable areas have shaken off poverty through #relocation. The population is equivalent to that of a moderately developed country.  
Since 2013, more than 3 million first Party secretaries and resident working team members have been selected and dispatched to carry out targeted #PovertyAlleviation, alongside township and village officials.  
 
 
From the White Paper: Significant Improvement in the Living Standards of the Poor  
President Xi had a phone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday.  
The strategy of targeted poverty alleviation is a major theoretical&practical innovation. The guidelines&measures can summarized as accomplishing "Targeted Efforts in Six Areas", taking "Five Measures for Poverty Eradication", & addressing "Five Questions in Poverty Alleviation".  
In addition to facts and figures, the latest White Paper Poverty Alleviation: #China's Experience and Contribution introduces the paradigm of China's governance and political development.  
#IMF: #China's economy is projected to grow at 8.4% in 2021 and 5.6% in 2022 after it had already returned to pre-COVID #GDP in 2020.  China's development will offer more opportunities to the whole world.
"Looking forward to a #WinterGames as successful as #Beijing2008." Diplomats from multiple countries watched a warming up ice hockey game at the Wukesong Sports Center,which was converted from a basketball court. Sustainable and environmentally friendly.  
As Xiamen University celebrates its centennial, Abdulla, a student from #SaudiArabia, enjoys his stay in the university & sees a bright future for cooperation and exchanges between #China and his own country. We do believe China's bond with other countries can grow even stronger.  
This young man is telling us how some fabricate stories to smear #Xinjiang.  
 
 
Liu Xin, the well-known CGTN anchor, shares the story of her trip to #Xinjiang.
The #US has turned 1/3 of #Guam territory into US military bases & is claiming more. The US should stop militarizing Guam & protect local residents' #HumanRights.
But mainstream #US media easily excited about #HumanRights issues showed collective silence over this. If the letter were addressed to #China instead of the US government, if it were about #Xinjiang instead of #Guam, what would have happened?
In a joint letter to the #US government, 3 #UN special rapporteurs accused the US government & military of ongoing human rights violations to the indigenous #Chamorro people of #Guam.  
#China aid #COVID19 #vaccines arrived in #Lebanon!
Feeling well. #Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic received a dose of a #ChineseVaccine, encouraging more people to get vaccinated against #COVID19.
State councilor & FM #WangYi had fruitful talks with visiting #ROK Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong.  
State Councilor & FM #WangYi spoke with Japanese Foreign Minister #ToshimitsuMotegi on the phone yesterday. Wang said that...  
 
No End in Sight. People involved in the War revealed the #US arrogance, indifference and refusal to admit mistakes that plunged Iraq into chaos. Still, there isn't end in sight to law and order in places where US interference exists.   
Say No! to the #US. Otherwise any country could be another #Iraq.  
 
The #US should take real actions to #StopAsianHate. It is about human rights protection.  
Terrorism is terrorism.  When combating this common enemy of humanity, counter-terrorism and deradicalization efforts must be taken.  
#ChineseVaccines are safe, people in Harare, #Zimbabwe told the Chinese reporter. The country's vaccination roll out is going on.

Qingtuan, sticky rice ball with sweet fillings, a #Qingmingfestival delicacy with a history over 1000 years.  Taste of spring.  
#Qingming, a holiday for spring, and a mourning day in Chinese tradition as well.  Today we salute our heroes with deepest respect.  You are always in our hearts.  
A video of nine years ago.  Migrant workers from #Henan Province went to #Xinjiang for their annual job- cotton picking.  It brought them good income and cross-region friendship.  
A glimpse into the lives of Uygur youths in Kashgar, #Xinjiang.   
Spring tea time🫖🍵, for picking leaves  
FM Hishammuddin bin Tun Hussein expressed his feelings in Chinese, and State Councilor Wang gave him a thumbs-up, saying "we are brothers". We can feel the warmth of friendship even behind the screen. This fully reflects the China-Malaysia comprehensive strategic partnership.  
Seeing is believing. Vladimir Norov, the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) shared his thoughts and experiences of his recent trip to China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in an interview with CGTN anchor Liu Xin.  
Next time you speak, please get your facts straight first.
If the EU really wants to abide by obligations under international law, please stop interfering in China's domestic affairs, stop spreading misinformation about China & tell your US ally to stop the political suppression on Chinese journalists.
5. To blame  before figuring out the facts or by deliberately confusing right & wrong only hurts EU credibility.
4. Is any EU journalist in China suffering harassment or obstruction? If there is, pls let us know. otherwise, better not make wanton comments without evidence.
3. Since 2019, the US denied visa to 20+ Chinese journalists without cause. In March 2020, the US expelled 60 Chinese journalists out of political oppresion. Now all US-based Chinese journalists have to  apply for visa extension every 3 months.
2. If Sudworth was indeed under threat, he could have called the police. But he didn't, because no one threatened him.
.@JosepBorrellF @ExtSpoxEU Some facts for your information: 1. John Sudworth left China's mainland on his own accord without notifying relevant department or fulfilling due procedures. BTW, is BBC a EU media outlet?  
Seeing is believing. #ChinaCottonAssociation welcomes overseas industry organizations, brands and third-party institutes to visit #Xinjiang for field studies.  
However, we are firmly opposed to strong ideological bias against #China , acts that violate the professional ethics and morality. We also firmly reject manufacturing fake news and disinformation to malign and attack China in the name of so-called freedom of the press.
If some Western media continue to put ideology above truth, it will only lead to shattered credibility. #China has always been and will continue to be committed to facilitating and helping foreign journalists in their reporting work in China.
Finally, I want to emphasize that the life of journalism lies in truth. You may not like #China , but you are not allowed to spread rumors and engage in smearing campaign in China.
After the abnormal departure of John Sudworth from China's mainland, some people came together to put on a farce, a textbook example of how to shift the blame to the innocent party by distortion of facts and fallacy of composition.  
On abnormal departure of John Sudworth of BBC: People with a clear conscience have nothing to fear at night.  
The most important outcome of the trip: #China & the 6 Middle East countries will continue to support each other firmly on matters of their core interests.
...and hope to contribute to regional peace & development through sincere cooperation.
3. #China is not in the Middle East for selfish gains, geographical jostling, or any sphere of influence. Instead, we uphold the spirit of equal friendly partnership, respect regional countries' choices,...
2. We support regional countries in stepping out of the shadow of major power geographical rivalry & take it into their own hands to resolve regional differences & disputes.
1.#China supports regional countries in ruling out external pressure & disruption, maintaining independence, and seeking a social system & governance model with their own characteristics.
State Councilor & Foreign Minister Wang Yi's Middle East trip conveyed the following key messages.
...have the right to choose a profession out of their own free will, get better payment & better life? Why should it become “forced labor” then?  
French media reported on "paid labor" in prison & lauded the practice. Good. But when prisoners in France have the right to improve employment skills through paid work so they can pursue a happy life after release, why can’t the innocent ethnic minorities in #Xinjiang ...
Today, when we fulfill commitment & uphold #WTO  rules, they are calling for tailor-made new rules for #China . Trying to manipulate the rules of the game to ensure they always win, this is as unfair as it gets & calls for true reform.
Major Western countries formulate most #WTO  rules. It is their customary practice to hold on to hegemony & contain developing countries’ growth. During negotiations over China’s WTO accession, they wouldn’t allow relaxing the rules for China.
If the allegation on #China  were true, why would so many countries & regions want to trade with China? Why would so many foreign companies come to invest & operate in China?
#China  is the largest trading partner of 120+ countries & regions. Despite the impact of #COVID19  & deep global economic recession, foreign investment in China increased by 81% in 2020.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of China’s #WTO  accession. We’ve honored our commitment, complied with WTO rules & firmly safeguard the WTO-centered multilateral trading regime.  
get equal payment in seeking employment, and create a better life with their own hands?   
If the prisoners in #France have the right to improve employment skills through paid work so that they could pursue a happy life after release, why can't the innocent ethnic minorities in #Xinjiang have the right to choose a profession out of their own free will,...  
to ensure that no external forces or their political agents will be able to instigate "color revolution" to endanger the security, stability&development of Hong Kong; to ensure that whoever administer Hong Kong can truly serve the interests & well-being of Hong Kong compatriots.
The primary responsibility & obligation of the Chinese government is to safeguard sovereignty, security of China’s territory, including Hong Kong; 
The turbulence over the proposed amendment bill in 2019 seriously undermined Hong Kong's constitutional & legal order, jeopardized China's sovereignty, security, development interests & Hong Kong's prosperity&stability. No sovereign country would ever tolerate anything like this.
In August 2014, the NPC Standing Committee further stipulated the roadmap for selecting the HKSAR's chief executive & forming LegCo through general elections. Unfortunately, the anti-China destabilizing forces vetoed the proposal.
The UK & US questioned the principle of "patriots administering Hong Kong", but……  
The vicious accusations the US flings at #Xinjiang reflect its past crimes. Just look at this Washington Post article which exposed how the US government persecuted Native Americans with lies, smallpox, etc. It’s time for US politicians to wake up from their “Truman Show”.  
It’s also evidence that the US strategic conspiracy is to destabilize #Xinjiang to contain China’s development, as Lawrence Wilkerson admitted.  
The US arbitrarily slapped the label of “genocide” on China based on nothing but the words of a few fake academics & false witnesses. This only exposes its hypocrisy behind all the talk about rule of law & rules.
China’s policy on ethnic minorities are far better & fairer than that of the US. Ethnic minorities in China lead a much happier life with equality & dignity than those in the US.
The few so-called “witnesses” are just trained “actors”. Not just #Xinjiang, people outside China, including in the US, have all exposed & refuted the lies in various ways.
As overwhelming facts have proven, the investigative report the US keeps citing & hyping up is disinformation fabricated by the likes of Adrian Zenz.  
Accusing China of “genocide” is the lie of the century. It rides roughshod over international law. To reach a finding of #genocide, the key elements must be proved with a “high level of certainty” & the Court must “be fully convinced” of the allegation.  
The outsiders who never took part in the joint study are now accusing the team of being “interfered”. This is highly frivolous & irresponsible. Only to achieve their hidden political agenda.
The experts decided independently on sites to visit, people to meet & subjects to talk about. The report was also drafted by the mission independently. It is just absurd to allege any sort of “interference”.
The 17 international experts who came to China were all selected by #WHO. Most are from Western countries including the US, the UK, France & Australia. China didn’t raise any objection to the makeup of the team. We offered the team every convenience.
I want to ask these people: How did you do in your own country to fight against #COVID19? What have you done for global anti-epidemic cooperation?
The US rallied a dozen countries to openly question & negate the report of the joint #WHO-China study. This is solid evidence of their disregard for science & political manipulation of study of origins.
We believe the joint #WHO-China study will help stimulate global cooperation in origin-tracing.
To politicize it will only severely hinder global cooperation in study of origins, jeopardize anti-pandemic cooperation & cost more lives. It is also a global mission that should be conducted in multiple countries & localities.
We commend the Chinese & international experts for their commitment to science, tireless industry & professionalism. Study of origins is a matter of science.
Today #China officially opened the #FAST, world's largest single-dish and most sensitive radio telescope, providing its research facilities to the world.  
Poll: About 70 percent of #HongKong residents supported the decision to improve HK's electoral system. 68.3 percent of the surveyed said the improvement will boost their confidence in HK's future.  
Remember what the #US & some of its allies did to #Iraq, #Syria & #Libya? Waged wars based on "evidence" which later proved to be false. The price is death & displacement of millions of #Muslims. Justice may be late, but will prevail in the end.  
#BCI Shanghai representative office stated: "Since 2012, the #Xinjiang project site has performed second-party credibility audits and third-party verifications over the years, and has never found a single case related to incidents of forced labor."
Some repeatedly allege that there is "#ForcedLabor" in #Xinjiang. But what's their evidence? Just the words of rumor-producers&spreaders.  
We call on all capable countries to do their best to help the countries in need, especially the developing ones.
#WHO DG Tedros says the inequitable distribution of #vaccines is a moral outrage. Agree. #China has been providing vaccine assistance to 80 countries & 3 intl organizations, exporting to 40+ countries, and in R&D and production cooperation with 10+.
It will contribute to forging a community with a shared future in #cyberspace by injecting developing countries' wisdom & strength into global digital governance.
The #China-#LAS Cooperation Initiative on #DataSecurity demonstrates the height of China-Arab strategic cooperation.  
日本の皆さん、パンダのシャンシャンの帰る日が12月末に再延期されることになりました🐼 まだ上野で会える時間がありますよ！ シャンシャン、日本の皆さんに仲良く遊んでもらって、たくさんの思い出を作ってきてね。  
What about the police officers in #HK? The attacks against the HK police back in 2019 were much more violent and brutal. Did the #British side call those mobs  disgraceful?   
Laughter, smiling faces and hospitality in #Xinjiang debunk all the lies and rumors.
"Cotton from my hometown feels soft but has strong competitiveness", Nigemaiti, a popular anchor, proudly advertised #XinjiangCotton on a live commerce program. He also joked to change his name as Nigemaimian, meaning selling cottons.  
 
 
The #RMB banknotes are printed in #Uyghur and three other ethnic languages besides #Mandarin. What about the #US dollar? And the #British pound sterling?
Some even cites #Uyghurs learning the #Chinese language as evidence of "genocide". What nonsense! Shouldn't citizens speak their countries' national common language?
For most of the #Muslim people, the #UnitedStates is certainly not the safest country to live in.
Clearly, they want nothing but to break #China's unity, security and stability to contain China's rise; and drive a wedge btw China and the #Muslim world to divert attention away from their own discrimination against and persecution of Muslims.
Yet they seem to have a particular interest in the #Uyghur people in #Xinjiang (let's not forget there are 56 ethnic groups in #China).
And how could they allow the serious discrimination against #Muslims in their own countries?
Obviously, some in the #US and #Europe don't really care about #Muslims. Or how could they, after 9/11, hit so many Muslim countries so hard in the name of counter-terrorism that hundreds of thousand of Muslims were killed and millions displaced?
Some in the #US and the #EU describe #China as the threat to the world. But they have been hoarding 60% vaccines of the world's total while giving none to other countries. Who's posing the threat?
Over 100 million！ This is the number of doses of #Chinese vaccines supplied globally and #vaccinations domestically administered.  
Hear the voices of true scholars.     
Ambassador Cui Tiankai took an interview with Christiane Amanpour：  
Mind your own business! HANDS OFF #XINJIANG!
What on earth have those MPs done when #COVID19 is still rampant in the #UK and so many people are dying? What have those MPs done about racism and social injustice in Britain? What have those MPs done with drug addicts and homeless people in the streets of their constituencies?
@BorisJohnson Those #British MPs are elected by their constituents in Britain. Their constituencies are not in #China. They do not have the right to interfere in China's internal affairs. Even the British voters do not authorize the MPs they elected to spread lies&disinformation.  
#Xinjiang, about 3 times as large as #France, 5 times #Italy, 6 #NewZealand or 7 #UK, is amazingly beautiful throughout the year. Just share some breathtaking pictures. Can't wait to go there.  
Again in #Guizhou, Gaopo.  Sunny and happy!  Amazingly beautiful!  
Another breathtaking attraction of nature, also in #Guizhou: definifely one of  the most beautiful cherry-blossom garden on our planet.  
 
Azalea "waves" covered the hills of a national park in #Guizhou, Southwest #China.  #Spring has been all around.  
 
A bird view of cotton picking in #Xinjiang. So many people show their appreciation in the comments.   
Check the #Xinhua report:  
#BCI Shanghai Office said, second-party credibility audits and third-party verifications  had never found a single case related to #forcedlabor.  
Top 10 cities with the longest #metro mileage in the world from 1890 to 2020. A microcosm of the development of the world and #China.  
 
President Vucic: #NATO attacked a sovereign country without #UN's approval. #Serbia is no longer the tormented country it was; it regained its strength&dignity; it strives to rebuild relations with the countries that had bombed it. But it will never forget what happened in 1999.  
Listen to a #Canadian's perspective of the truth of "#Genocide" in #Xinjiang.  
Flags are flown half-staff, vigils held and speeches delivered. But damage is done and trauma often stays. Nearly 3,800 anti-Asian racist incidents reported over roughly a year. Where is due intervention? Where is the end of #racism and #discrimination?  
Listen to the facts about #Uyghurs in #Xinjiang.  
#XinjiangCotton is clear and innocent.  
Take a close look at cotton picking in #Xinjiang. Local agriculture department: In 2020, 69.83% of Xinjiang cotton was harvested by machines. The number was up to 95% in northern Xinjiang. The mechanization in southern Xinjiang has increased steadily. Forced labor?  
#Mississippi in 1908 🆚 #Xinjiang in 2015  A shotgun and several hounds 🆚 smiles and harvests. Forced labor?  
Factories are built to create jobs for the people, incl. ethnic minorities, to earn more&live better. While most people see it as a good way to alleviate poverty, some insist it’s repression&forced labor. Why? The only reason: Repression is what they have done for over a century.
On 24 March, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave an interview to #AlArabiya in #Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. During the interview, He put forth a five-point initiative on achieving security and stability in the #MiddleEast.  
The #FiveEyes&some European countries are ganging up on China in a way that resembles the Eight-Power Allied Forces in the late Qing Dynasty. With outdated thinking, they neither understand China nor the world. The UN has 190+ member states. China have friends all over the world.  
.@Europarl_EN The #China-#EU investment agreement is not a "gift" from one side to the other, but rather mutually beneficial.
What happened is clear. The #EU made provocation first, by attacking & sanctioning #China based on lies. China's reaction is necessary and justified. China doesn't seek trouble, but if trouble comes, we don't shy away.  
Speaking of "accountability", I wonder how is #Australia doing with those investigations into grave crimes in #Afghanistan? Will the "#FiveEyes" alliance and the #EU hold Australia accountable?
.@SpeakerPelosi It's the rights & dignity of minority groups in the #US that need defense. Those elected by American people need do sth to ensure that #GeorgeFloyd can breathe, that #AsianAmericans are free from  hate crimes, that American people's lives are better protected.  
#Guilin scenery is second to none,  so is #China-#Russia partnership, which has contributed  much stability & positivity to the world. Together, we'll uphold #multilateralism, promote greater #democracy in international relations & lend fresh impetus to world peace & development.
The frequent occurrence of violent crimes of racial discrimination, including the latest ones in #Atlanta& #Colorado, reflects the #US failure in safeguarding #humanrights of its own people. US is urged to honor its commitment & take concrete steps to protect its people's lives.
Providing convenience to those inoculated with #Chinese #vaccines does not affect the existing policy for those who haven't. In the meantime, necessary quarantine and observation measures for all inbound personnel will continue to be implemented.

Right! Human beings are not bargaining chips. Then release Ms. #MengWanzhou immediately. She has been arbitrarily and unreasonably detained for 845 days.
#Spring has just arrived in Linzhi, #Tibet, before climbing up the plateau and rousing more blossoms.  
It turns out a high-speed rail running through flowering  canola fields can be a refreshment for eyes and minds! Comments show many viewers agree.  
The train of #spring, an annual attraction at foot of the #GreatWall (Beijing section) runs through wild peaches in bloom.  Thanks to #GreenChina effort, forest coverage of the city will reach 44.6% within this year.  
If the U.S. is serious about addressing racial discrimination, then the problem would have been addressed long ago. End the #DOUBLESTANDARD. Stop ganging up to point fingers at others while staying aloof from solving one's own problems.
Racial discrimination against Asians is DEEP-SEATED. One in every four young #AsianAmericans  is targeted in racial bullying. There were 122 incidents of anti-Asian American hate crimes in 16 of the most populous cities in the #US in 2020,up by almost 150% over the previous year.  
The Atlanta shooting of Asians, including Chinese, is a result of hatred and racial discrimination. #StopAsianHate  
Asians have stepped up to DEFEND their own rights and interests. A Chinese granny fought off the attacker. Asian Americans take to the street across the U.S. to call for an end to anti-Asian violence. Enough is enough.  
The Kuwait Tower lightened up to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the establishment of #ChinaKuwait diplomatic relationship.
A photo exhibition themed on #Xinjiang is opened in #Beijing, showing the beauty of nature, local happy life, rich ethnic culture, poverty alleviation efforts and better development in the region.  
They will have to pay a price for their ignorance and arrogance.  
According to #US media, in 2016, a #Uyghur couple went to #Italy with 3 children, leaving another 4 in #Xinjiang. If there's "forced sterilization" and "genocide" in Xinjiang as some in the west claim, how come this Uyghur couple have 7 children?
Leaders, politicians and diplomats that have wisdom and serve their people will not pursue the so-called "alliance of democracies". Many countries in the region want to see a sound and steady China-US relationship. Working together for a better life is #democracy in real sense.
#China never seeks confrontation, conflict or division. On the contrary, China has been advocating a community with a shared future for mankind.
I wonder in what way the west #democracy is superior. Amid #COVID19, the world's richest nations watch hundreds of thousands of their people die. Is this democracy? While western politicians are busy wooing their party voters, the #Chinese government serves all wholeheartedly.
#Democracy comes about when power belongs to people. There is no unified model for democracy. Sovereign states should be respected in their independent choose of development path. No one has the right to meddle in their internal affairs under the guise of "democracy".
The #US, #UK and #Canada together account for only 5.7% of the world's population. Even if #EU is added, that will be about 11%. They cannot represent the international community.
#China & #Russia, with great sense of commitment & responsibility as major countries in the world & permanent members of the #UNSC, will give strong backing to each other on issues of core interests as important partners & play an underpinning role in international affairs.
In Guilin, FM Wang Yi & FM #Lavrov issued a joint statement that shed light on what is real #humanrights, #democracy, international order & #multilateralism. #China & #Russia will jointly and resolutely defend international justice & fairness.
During the colonial period: 5.5 million people in #Algeria massacred by the #French army.
1904-1908: over 100,000 indigenous people of #Namibian tribes killed by #German military, including 3/4 of the Herero people and over 1/2 of the Nama people. #WWII: almost six million #Jews slaughtered by Nazi Germany, including one million children.
1870s: the #Canadian government set up residential schools to carry out cultural genocide policies. Over 150,000 indigenous children were sent to such schools, of which more than 50,000 died of abuses.
It must be pointed out that these countries, who proclaim themselves to be #humanrights "judges"&are keen to lecture others, have an ignoble record on human rights. They have absolutely no right to criticize #China, much less to shift blames to China for what they have committed.
The west shall entertain no illusion as regards #China's firm determination to defend national interests and dignity. It's a courtesy to reciprocate what we receive. They will have to pay a price for their ignorance and arrogance.
#China is not what it was 120 years ago, when foreign powers could force open its door with guns. Certain colluding individuals in politics, academics and media should think twice if they think they could make wanton smears with impunity.
How can people enjoy rights if they lost their lives? Some in the west talk a lot about #humanrights, but who and what right on earth are they protecting? In what way are they respecting and protecting human rights?
Tens of hundreds of people died of #COVID19 because these most developed countries are indifferent to their people's rights to life and health. They hoard #vaccines far in excess of their population's needs, leaving developing countries struggling with insufficient vaccines.
#France, #UK and #EU launched a war in #Libya, leading to regional turbulence & grave migrant and refugee issues. Shouldn't they be held accountable?
The #US and #UK used some test tube of washing powder and a staged video as evidence to launch wars against sovereign countries such as #Iraq and #Syria, leaving numerous death and displacement. Shouldn't they be sanctioned?
What the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU have done is utter denigration and offense to the reputation and dignity of the #Chinese people, blatant interference of China's internal affairs, and grave violation of China's sovereignty and security interests.
Some in the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU clearly don't want to acknowledge the real facts about #Xinjiang & don't care about the truth, but hold on to accusations based on lies & false information. They just do not want to see #China's success, development and better livelihood.
In 40 years, the #Uyghur population has grown from 5.5 million to 12.8 million. The fact that #Xinjiang residents of various ethnic groups enjoy stability, security, development and progress, makes it one of the most successful human rights stories.
"Pointless, self-aggrandising and harmful" Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó on #EU's sanctions against persons and institutions in #China and #Myanmar.  
True voice of #HongKong people!  
If some people in the #EuropeanParliament want to express their opinion at the cost of defaming and hurting others based on lies and false information, then of course innocent victims have the right to defend their own interests and dignity.
The purposes and principles of the #UN Charter must be upheld. Real multilateralism & greater democracy in international relations should be pursued.  
#China and #Russia both agree that #US should take a hard look at the damage it has done to world peace and development, stop its bullying practice of ganging up on others and meddling in other countries' internal affairs.  
State Councilor and FM Wang Yi met with FM #Lavrov in #Guilin, Guangxi today. Broad consensus was reached based on strategic communication.  
We appreciate Foreign Minister #Lavrov's remarks that #China and #Russia should strengthen high-level collaboration to advance multipolarity. Our cooperation is all the more important in a turbulent world. Surely his visit will further cement our high- level bilateral relations.
People in the vast majority of countries, including some US allies, hope to see peaceful co-existence of #China and the #US. The US should stop coercing others into following its footstep to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's interests.
The attempt to form a clique to pressure, blackmail, and even intimidate #China by virtue of someone else won't work. There is direct flight between #Canberra and #Beijing. Taking a detour via #WashingtonDC is only counterproductive.
While gloomy filters can barely hide bias and prejudice, truthful, objective and fair stories always shine.
American vlogger Jerry Kowal just flew to #Shanghai from #SF a few days ago. Upon his arrival, he documented and compared the two countries' different approaches to #COVID19 prevention from his own perspective.  
As #SpringEquinox has just arrived, flowers are now in full bloom, pears, cheeries, peaches and so on. Farmlands become artworks with canola blossoms.  
Cherry blossoms all around #Wuhan.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Moments in #Anchorage  
Nice weekend!🌞 #BreakDancing for break time at a construction site in #China.  A worker turns to be  a dancer.  
Listen carefully to #China's national anthem to learn the public opinion of the 1.4 bln Chinese people. The #US should overcome its hegemonic habit of interfering in China's internal affairs. China, as always, will be firm&capable enough to safeguard national sovereignty&dignity.
The #US values & rules are not international values & rules. With its ugly #humanrights records & 500k-plus #COVID death toll, the US is in no position to talk to #China condescendingly.
The #Chinese delegation travelled to #Anchorage with sincerity. But the #US escalated so-called sanctions on China on the eve of the dialogue&made groundless accusations in the opening session. It is miscalculated&totally wrong to seek a "better position of strength" in this way.
Stop #AAPI Hate's report indicates Chinese are the largest ethnic group that report experiencing hate. Some anti-China forces have spread lies&disinformation about China, fanned racism&hatred. The US should address racism and protect safety&legitimate rights of Chinese in the US.  
◆ The #US has a huge amount of electoral legislation. In the past two years alone, members of the US Congress have introduced more than 40 bills to improve its electoral system.
◆ Both #US Senate and the House of Representatives have independent committees on ethics, which are responsible for investigating and adjudicating any alleged acts of disloyalty. 18 members of the US Congress were disqualified for disloyalty to the Union in history.
◆ The #US law stipulates that whoever knowingly or willfully advocates the overthrowing or destroying of the government or organizes or helps or attempts to organize such society or groups shall be ineligible for employment by the US or any department or agency thereof.
◆ The #US Constitution and criminal law stipulate that whoever, guilty of treason, shall be incapable of holding any office under the US.
◆ The #US law clearly defines the basic obligation of public service. Its first general principle is requiring employees of public service to place loyalty to the Constitution, the laws and ethical principles above private gain.
"Governance by patriots" is a matter of course for all sovereign states in the world including the #US. Here are some facts:
The #US forgets the fact that #HK affairs are #China's internal affairs. It also forgets that the US House of Representatives passed the "For the People Act" to improve its own electoral system on the same day the #NPC announced its agenda for HK.
Obviously, the #US is addicted to sanctions. It's mad at the #NPC's decision to improve #HK's electoral system and "patriots administering HK".
It's reported that some #US officials said the US is not prepared to improve relations with #China when #Australia is being subjected to the so-called economic coercion. Interesting. The US is now switching from "America First" to "Australia First"?
The 3rd batch of Chinese vaccines has arrived in #Hungary, 43 days earlier than the contract deadline. #China has tried its best joining the world's efforts for fighting against #COVID19.  
Lead #Chinese scientist of #WHO joint team addresses key issues ahead of joint report release:  
Time for #Springploughing now!  Farmers started their work all around the country. And in #Tibet, it is such a special event for people to celebrate.  
 
Yang Huazhen, from Aba #Tibetan&Qiang autonomous prefecture, #Sichuan, devoted herself to recreating the Qiang #embroidery and saved the ethnic beauty from disappearance. Thus she evokes empathy among cultures and, via top brands, takes it to the world.  
A slow train for public good in #Sichuan takes people out of and into the unique Yi ethnic market. It helps a lot for the better life of the local people. Join the trip with Stu, the British vlogger with a similar-sounding Chinese name.   
Top-flight performance. #China's civil aviation industry expects to see passenger trips and the volume of cargo and mail transported by air bounce back to pre-epidemic level.  
The decision on improving the electoral system of the #HongKong SAR wins wide support in HK.  
What a sweet smile! This moment was captured accidentally by a volunteer teacher in a rural primary school in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The county where the school is located shook off poverty in 2020. Now the children can connect with the world via internet, & vice versa.  
A hip-pop song for the 14th Five-Year Plan (#FYP). From "#MadeinChina" to "China made it"!

#Chinese vaccines just arrived in #Gabon and welcomed by the Prime Minister Ossouka Raponda and the Foreign Minister Moubelet Boubeya at the airport.  
Congratulations to #EileenGu, the beautiful brave girl, for winning 2 gold medals!  So proud of you and look forward to more wonderful performances!
A promise is a promise.  This is a promise for spring.  Mr. Han Tianqi, the 99-year-old expert astronomer, kept his promise to have Xu Jian, member of #Fujian medical team who helped him recover from #COVID19 last year, enjoying cherry blossoms in #Wuhan now.  
9:30am Mar. 14, #Beijing time.  #COVID19 vaccines administered in #China's capital city reached 10 million doses at the moment.  
Spring time in #Wuhan! The Cherry blossoms are now welcoming visitors from around the country. And in this weekend, it has come to be a special event of gratitude for the medical workers who helped the city fighting against #COVID19 pandemic last year.  
Here's her story.  
From 17-year-old fresh looks in bright-colored dresses to her 60s in a wheelchair with aged & lined face, Zhang Guimei has dedicated her life to helping girls from families in extreme poverty into schooling and saved their future.  
#IOC President Thomas Bach: The IOC has received a kind offer from #China to make additional vaccine doses available to participants in both editions of the Olympic Games, #Tokyo2020  and #Beijing2022. Indeed, China is ready to welcome athletes from the whole world.

Greening #China is a never-ending mission carried on generation by generation and shovel by shovel. #NationalTreePlantingDay  
The overwhelming voice of justice by many developing countries at the #UNHRC stands in sharp contrast to the distorted narrative and groundless accusations by just only a few countries. Lies are lies and can never stand the test of facts.
There has been no such thing as "genocide", "forced labor" or "religious oppression" in #Xinjiang. These sensational accusations are the results of ignorance & bias. They are ill-intentioned political hype-up that totally run counter to facts.
On behalf of 64 countries, #Cuba made a joint statement on #Xinjiang at the 46th #UNHRC session to support #China. Many other countries also spoken out at the Council to support China's legitimate stance.
 
10年前的今天，日本东北地区遭受强烈地震和海啸袭击，造成重大人员伤亡和财产损失。我们向日本人民表达诚挚慰问。衷心期待在日本政府和各界共同努力下，受灾地区早日完成重建，实现复兴。
東日本大震災と津波被害１０周年にあたり、日本の皆さんに心からお見舞い申し上げます。貴国民の御努力のもと、被災地域の一日も早い復興もお祈りします。
 
 
What do other countries want from cooperation with China? This is a question China asks itself often. Former UNDP economist Hannah Ryder on China-Africa cooperation: if there's one partner that can help on this and remain consistent, it's got to be China.  
Moments during the #TwoSessions, inside and outside of the Great Hall of the People.  
#Xinjiang's reality features dynamism and diversity, rather than depression and desperation in some #Western media reports.  
How has the #US arrived at this "conclusion"? Just based on the words of a handful of liars who hate #China?!  
@StateDeptSpox Ned Price claimed "genocide has taken place in #Xinjiang". Has he looked up the word "genocide" in the dictionary? Does he know what the word exactly means? Has he ever been to #China?  
#UN Secretary-General congratulates #China on the successful efforts in the fight against extreme poverty.   
🇨🇳A #population of 1.4 billion. 🇨🇳A #workforce of 900 million. 🇨🇳A #market of 120 million market entities. Sure thing that #China will offer more opportunities and wider room for cooperation with the #EU as well as other partners.
#China has outlined a blueprint for the next 5 years not only to develop its economy, technologies and overall strength, but also to offer great opportunities for businesses from around the world.  
Facts speak louder than words. There will be a day when he and other flagrant slanderers are punished by justice.
#AdrianZenz has been fabricating rumors and lies on #Xinjiang. His lies about forced labor have caused injury to reputation and huge economic loss of these farmers and companies.
Some cotton farmers and processing companies in #Xinjiang have filed a civil lawsuit against #AdrianZenz, seeking for a formal apology, rehabilitation of reputation and compensation.

How to take a "standard" photo of #China by Western standards?  Must include: Chinese flags, police, traffic cams, long focus, low angle and gloomy filters. Must not include: blue sky, smiling passers-by, an objective view of China.
"How can we expect someone who does not love his motherland to truly love #Hong Kong?" #PatriotsGoverningHongKong  
A touching story for #WomensDay. A story recounted by Chinese President recently during the #NationalPeoplesCongress. It is about 3,000 orphans from Shanghai survived famine in early 1960s with love and care of their "mothers" in #InnerMongolia.   
In Jan & Feb, the first two months of 2021, #China's foreign trade reached 5.44 trillion yuan ($837.3 billion), up 32.2% year-on-year. Export growth rate reached 60.6%, higher than expected, creating more confidence in the prospects of export growth and economic recovery.  
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi Meets the Press  
Every year representatives of ALL ethnic minorities in #China attend #TwoSessions (over 13% of all deputies), proudly dressed in traditional costume. Wonder anyone seen such multi-ethnicity in congress of those countries smearing China?  
In #April when #spring comes, the Foreign Ministry will hold a special promotion event for #Hubei. It will present a new Hubei that has emerged stronger from the difficulties, and build new bridges connecting it to the world.
The heroic people of #Wuhan and Hubei, bearing in mind the greater good, made enormous sacrifice for a national victory over #COVID19 and contributed significantly to the global #COVID19 response.
#China hopes to see and welcomes more Edgar Snows of this new era among foreign #journalists.
I hope that when reporting on #China, foreign #journalists will not apply any filter to their camera, beauty or gloomy. Truthful, objective and fair stories will always appeal to people and can stand the scrutiny of history.
However the world changes, the #media should stand by their professional ethics.
#China today needs to better understand the world, and the world needs to better understand China.
With admirable professionalism and moral ethics, he devoted his life to enhancing mutual understanding between the #Chinese and #American peoples. The Chinese people have fond memories of him even to this day.
#Snow was not a communist. Yet when looking at the #CPC, he carried no ideological bias, stayed truthful and objective and stood by justice and conscience.
Since #COVID19 started, many foreign journalists have stayed on their post, overcome difficulties, and worked non-stop to help the world know the #Chinese people's fight against the #virus. Your efforts are deeply appreciated.
The #media is an important bridge that helps countries communicate with and understand one another.
The #Chilean poet Pablo Naruda wrote, eternal friendship makes you believe in good things in the world and convinces you that there is a door ready for you to open.
The #pandemic has not hindered our #cooperation. Instead, our peoples have grown closer and are bound by broader common interests.
#China and #LatinAmerican and #Caribbean countries have stood alongside and supported each other in #COVID19 response and economic recovery. Our cooperation best illustrates that "a bosom friend afar brings a distant land near".
No matter how the situation evolves, China will not waver in its commitment to advancing #China-#Myanmar relations, and will not change the course of promoting friendship and cooperation.
And developing friendship with #China has also been a consensus across all sectors of #Myanmar.
#China's friendship policy toward #Myanmar is for all the people of Myanmar. Over the years, we have maintained friendly exchanges with various political parties in Myanmar, including the National League for Democracy.
#China and #Myanmar are "pauk-phaw" brothers connected by the same mountains and rivers, and are a community with a shared future through thick and thin.
The immediate priority is to prevent further bloodshed and conflict, and ease and cool down the situation as soon as possible.
I hope that the relevant parties in #Myanmar will keep calm & exercise restraint, act in the fundamental interests of the people, address their differences through dialogue&consultation within the constitutional&legal framework, and continue to advance the democratic transition.
#Peace and #stability are the prerequisite for a country's development.
Second, continue with the full and effective implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (#DOC) in order to build consensus, enhance mutual trust, advance cooperation, and maintain overall stability in the #SouthChinaSea.
First, remove distractions and press ahead with #COC consultations, and work toward the early conclusion of a set of regional rules that are more substantive and effective, consistent with international law and serve the needs of all parties.
#China and #ASEAN countries need to continue to "walk with two legs" on the #SouthChinaSea issue.
Countries in the region and around the world can all see clearly in recent years that the factors of instability and security risks in the #SouthChinaSea come mainly from outside the region.
The #US and #Iran can move forward in a step-by-step and reciprocal manner.
We hope the #US side will demonstrate sincerity by taking actions as quickly as possible, including removing the unjustified unilateral #sanctions and the "long-arm jurisdiction" on third-party entities and individuals.
The #Iranian nuclear issue is a sensitive issue that affects the whole situation in the #MiddleEast and the #GulfRegion.
We hope that renewed #China-#US cooperation on #ClimateChange will bring positive "climate change" to the relations between China and the United States.
#China welcomes #US return to the #ParisAgreement and expects that the US will shoulder its responsibility and make its due contribution.
Together, we will draw a new blueprint for global #biodiversity conservation in the next decade and pledge new actions for building a shared future for all life on Earth.
This year, #China will host the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to Convention on Biological Diversity (#COP15) in #Kunming, Yunnan Province. As the host country, China is ready to work with all parties to ensure positive outcomes of the Conference.
The philosophy proposed by President Xi Jinping that "blue waters and green mountains are indeed gold and silver mountains" is now a vision shared by all #Chinese people.
#China has all along made efforts to promote #ecological progress and taken concrete actions on global #ClimateGovernance.
Building a green and livable planet and pursuing #SustainableDevelopment is a responsibility for all members of the international community. Facing the challenges of our times, protecting the #environment is not a choice to make, but a call that we must answer.
We will realize full #digitalization of our #overseas consular services. With a click on the digital devices at home, overseas #Chinese can access 24/7 online services for travel documents application and consular assistance and protection.
We will roll out #HealthCertificates for international travelers to facilitate safe and orderly flow of personnel.
We will launch a #SpringVaccinationProgram to assist and secure #vaccination for our citizens with #Chinese or foreign #vaccines.
With concrete actions, we have reassured our compatriots #overseas: Our mission is to serve the people and we will leave no one behind; our diplomats will not stand back until the #pandemic is completely defeated.
All of us in the diplomatic service worked around the clock, with many on the front line, to launch a special campaign of consular protection for #Chinese nationals in every corner of the globe.
The worst situation often brings out the best of love & compassion. The Party and the government care deeply about the life and health of each and every #Chinese national abroad. The Foreign Ministry and our missions all over the world rose to the occasion and swung into action.
The unexpected #pandemic stopped our compatriots #overseas from returning home and put their life and health in jeopardy. Here I wish to extend my heartfelt sympathies to all of them.
What happened again proves that initiating #confrontation will not solve the problem, and that returning to peaceful #negotiation is the right way forward.
#China and #India are each other's friends and partners, not threats or rivals. The two sides need to help each other succeed instead of undercutting each other; we should intensify cooperation instead of harboring suspicion at each other.
The #China-#India relationship is essentially about how the world's two largest developing countries get along and pursue development and rejuvenation together.
To use a train analogy, #China in the new development stage is like an express train with greater driving force and load capacity accelerating toward a new goal. We welcome all countries to get on board and move toward a future of shared prosperity.
#China will create a more pro-business environment, pursue #OpeningUp at a higher level, and work with all countries to accelerate the building of an open world economy.
We are ready to work with all stakeholders to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation(#BRI) with renewed commitment and greater resilience. Together, we can turn Belt and Road cooperation into a journey toward common development and prosperity for all.
As we pursue a new development paradigm, we will explore better pathways for Belt and Road cooperation and offer greater opportunities to #BRI partners.
#COVID19 has changed the world in profound ways, but the need for Belt and Road cooperation(#BRI) has not subsided, and #China's commitment to cooperation has not changed.
We are also building a #GreenSilkRoad, under which we have intensified cooperation on green energy, green infrastructure and green finance. Our goal is to make the #BRI a robust engine for #LowCarbon transformation and green recovery in the #postcovid world.
We are building a #DigitalSilkRoad, a corridor of smooth information flow that will keep #BRI partners digitally connected.
Together, we are building a #HealthSilkRoad. Our cooperation on pandemic response has turned the Belt and Road into a corridor for life-saving supplies.
We have honored the principle of joint discussion, acted on the principle of joint construction, and prioritized the principle of joint benefit-sharing.
Since last year, the #pandemic has affected the world in many respects. Yet despite the headwinds, Belt and Road cooperation(#BRI) has not paused, but forged ahead with new outcomes, strong resilience and great vitality.
We would hope to see a clear departure from the previous administration's dangerous practice of "crossing the red line" and "playing with fire", and we hope that the #Taiwan question will be handled prudently and properly.
We hope the new #US administration will appreciate the great sensitivity of the #Taiwan question, and will abide by the one-China principle and the three Sino-US communiqués.
The one-China principle is the political foundation of the #China-#US relationship, a red line that should not be crossed. On the #Taiwan question, there is no room for compromise or concession from the Chinese government.
The two sides of the #TaiwanStrait must be and will surely be reunified. This is the trend of history and the collective will of the entire #Chinese nation. It will not and cannot be changed.
The 30th anniversary provides a new starting point, from which #China is ready to work with #ASEAN to build an even closer community with a shared future, and open up another 30 years of even greater cooperation.
We have developed a sense of a shared future and a partnership through thick and thin. And we have embraced a shared vision to revitalize #Asia and usher in a brighter future for our region.
#Confucius once observed, "One should be able to establish himself at the age of thirty." After 30 years of cooperation through rain or shine, #China and #ASEAN have established a shared belief in solidarity, equality and mutual assistance.
This only shows that they do not care about the truth. They are only interested in political maneuvering, and creating the so-called #Xinjiang issue to undermine security and stability in Xinjiang and hold back #China's development.
They chose to dance with the few anti-China elements in their clumsy dramas, instead of acknowledging the progress in #Xinjiang.
Some #western politicians chose to believe in the lies made up by a few, instead of listening to the voice of 25 million #Xinjiang residents of various ethnic groups.
The claim that there is genocide in #Xinjiang couldn't be more preposterous. It is just a rumor fabricated with ulterior motives, and a lie through and through.
Speaking of #genocide, many people would have in their minds the native #Americans of the 16th century, #African slaves of the 19th century, the #Jewish people of the 20th century, and the aboriginal #Australians who are still struggling even today.
Let's focus our eyes on #Tokyo this summer and meet in #Beijing next year.
...and make the #Olympics a platform for deepening friendship between the two peoples and an opportunity for furthering the relationship between the two countries.
As the two countries will host the #OlympicGames this year and the next, the two sides have every reason to support each other in hosting the two grand events,...
I hope that Japanese society will embrace a more objective and rational perception of China so as to solidify public support for long-term steady progress in #China-#Japan relations.
For the #China-#Japan relationship to be more mature and stable, the two countries need to stay focused without being distracted by any single event.
Facing the new problems and challenges in #globalization, the answer is not to retreat into #protectionism, isolation or decoupling, but to work together to make globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all.
...we must stay committed to the right direction of economic #globalization; and we must stay committed to the central role of the #WTO.
The past two decades have taught us four important things: we must stay committed to the fundamental policy of #OpeningUp; we must stay committed to the principle of win-win cooperation;...
Accession to the #WTO was a milestone in #China's opening-up as well as in the process of economic #globalization.
Countries should treat each other with #MutualRespect and #inclusiveness so as to prosper respectively and together.
In #Chinese culture, seeking harmony without uniformity is a philosophy of the virtuous. #Western culture values respect as a quality of a gentleman.
#Diversity is the integral feature of human civilization, and difference in system should not be the ground for #antagonism or #confrontation. Exchanges and mutual learning can enhance mutual understanding and drive common progress.
Our world cannot afford to fall apart, still less return to conflicts.
To smear or attack others for their different system or even claim superiority is in essence "hegemony of system".
Whether a path works for a country depends on how it fits the country's conditions.
Progress of human civilization cannot be achieved with only one pathway, nor should there be only one model. Choice of system should be made in a tailor-made way, rather than through trimming the feet to fit in the shoes.
#China hopes that all members of the international community will work together to light up humanity's way forward with the torch of #multilateralism.
#Multilateralism with one's own interests taking precedence is still unilateral thinking. "Selective multilateralism" is not the right choice.
#Multilateralism is a banner, not a pretext; a conviction, not a rhetoric. Building small circles in the name of multilateralism is in fact "group politics".
It means openness and inclusiveness instead of closeness and exclusion; and equal-footed consultation instead of supremacy over others.
True #multilateralism means observing the purposes and principles of the #UN Charter, upholding the UN-centered international system, and making international relations more democratic.
The way to address the various challenges in our world is for countries to uphold true #multilateralism.
#Multilateralism has remained a firm commitment of #China, a commitment that has never wavered despite changing times or circumstances.
The two important speeches have pointed the way forward for our times and cleared doubts for many in the world. Both are widely commended by the international community.
Four years later, in response to the uncertainties of the future of #multilateralism, President Xi shed light on the issue by putting forward #China's proposal for upholding multilateralism and building a community with a shared future for mankind.
Four years ago, in response to the debate over whether to continue #globalization, President Xi stepped forward to send a strong message in support of economic globalization.
China will work with Arab states in solidarity, pursue common progress, make good preparations for a China-Arab states summit, add new dimensions to the China-Arab states strategic partnership, & strive for more achievements in building a Sino-Arab community with a shared future.
As an #Arab saying goes, friendship is a tree with good faith as roots and goodwill as branches.
We hope that all capable countries will do what they can to provide #vaccines to countries in need, especially developing countries, so that people all over the world will have access to affordable vaccines, vaccines that truly benefit the people.
#China opposes "vaccine nationalism". We reject any "vaccine divide" or any attempt to politicize #vaccine cooperation.
Whether it is a #Chinese vaccine or not, it is a good vaccine so long as it is safe and effective.
#China is a firm believer in making #CovidVaccines a public good, a committed frontrunner in promoting international vaccine cooperation, and a steadfast advocate for equitable vaccine distribution.
#Vaccines are a powerful weapon against the virus and bring hope for saving lives. They should serve the entire world and benefit all humanity.
#China and #Europe are two important players in this multi-polar world. Their relationship is equal and open, not targeting any third party or controlled by anyone else.
...and when embracing cooperation with an independent spirit, #China and #Europe can accomplish great things.
#China and #Europe share extensive common interests, and win-win cooperation is the main thrust of their relationship; China and Europe are two great civilizations capable of dialogue and exchanges, and they are not systemic rivals;...
In the face of crises and challenges, #China-#Europe relations have demonstrated resilience and vitality, sending out a positive message to the world.
The #UnitedNations is not a club for big or rich countries. All countries enjoy sovereign equality, and no country is in a position to dictate international affairs.
...upholding the purposes and principles of the #UN Charter; preserving the central role of the #UnitedNations in the international system; and keeping to the basic rule of equal-footed consultations at the United Nations.
In our view, no matter how the situation may evolve and how the reform may proceed, the following principles must be preserved:...
Given the profound evolution of the international situation, the international community is expecting the #UnitedNations to keep pace with the times and improve itself through reform.
#China champions equity and justice, and stands for equality among all countries regardless of their size. China's vote in the #UnitedNations always belongs to the developing world.
From that day on, the People's Republic of #China has contributed its share to world peace and development as a trustworthy and reliable participant in this noble cause.
With a major country of one-fourth of the world's population rejoining the family of nations, the #UnitedNations finally achieved universality in a real sense.
Fifty years ago, the 26th session of the #UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to restore the lawful seat of the People's Republic of #China in the #UnitedNations.
We are ready to work with the #UnitedStates to follow through on the outcomes of this important phone call, and set #China-#US relations on a new path of healthy and steady growth.
The two heads of state had an in-depth exchange of views on #China-#US relations and pointed the way forward for bringing the relationship back on track.
On the #ChineseNewYear's eve last month, President Xi Jinping had a phone call with President Joe Biden.
We hope that the #UnitedStates will move in the same direction and remove all its unreasonable restrictions on bilateral cooperation as early as possible, not create new obstacles.
In the interest of the two countries and the whole world, cooperation should be the main goal for both #China and the #UnitedStates.
As two countries with different social systems, #China and the #UnitedStates naturally have differences and disagreements. What matters most is to manage them effectively through candid communication to prevent strategic miscalculation and avoid conflict and confrontation.
It is important that the #UnitedStates recognize this as soon as possible. Otherwise, the world will remain far from tranquility.
For quite some time, the #UnitedStates has been willfully interfering in other countries' internal affairs in the name of democracy and human rights. This has created lots of trouble in the world and, in some cases, turbulence and conflict.
The Chinese people are in the best position to tell whether #China is doing a good job. The Chinese people can best decide what is the right thing for China to do.
We also have the confidence to usher in a brighter future for #HongKong.
We have the resolve to continue to implement the policy of One Country, Two Systems under which the people of #HongKong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy.
#HongKong's shift from chaos to stability fully serves the interests of all parties. It will provide stronger safeguards for protecting the rights and interests of Hong Kong residents and the lawful interests of foreign investors.
No one cares more about #HongKong's democracy and continued prosperity and stability than the Central Government of #China.
How can we expect someone who does not love his motherland to truly love #HongKong? Loving Hong Kong and loving the motherland are consistent requirements.
Loyalty to the motherland is a basic political ethic of all public office holders and aspirants anywhere in the world. #HongKong is no exception.
It is a constitutional power and responsibility of the #NPC, and is totally constitutional, lawful and justified.
The move to improve #HongKong's electoral system and ensure "patriots administering Hong Kong" is necessitated by the need to advance the One Country, Two Systems cause and maintain long-term stability in Hong Kong.
#China will work with #Africa to pursue high-quality Belt and Road cooperation (#BRI) and build an even stronger community with a shared future to drive Africa's development and revitalization.
China-Africa cooperation stands as a model of South-South cooperation, and a fine example of international cooperation with Africa.
This bond of friendship is growing ever stronger as time goes by. #China and #Africa are perpetual good friends and good partners with a shared future.
#China and #Africa enjoy a profound friendship forged during the struggle for national independence and liberation. We are comrades-in-arms as well as brothers and sisters.
...steel the spine of #China's diplomacy with the Party's fine traditions, seek inspirations from the Party's history and experience, and keep breaking new ground in China's distinctive major-country diplomacy.
We will continue to uphold the Party's leadership of diplomatic work, fully implement Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy,...
The Party's leadership is the biggest political advantage of #China's diplomacy and the fundamental safeguard for continued victory in China's diplomatic endeavors.
To pursue peaceful development and win-win cooperation and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind is a provision in the Constitution of the #CPC and the Constitution of the PRC. It is also the goal of #China's diplomacy.
Cherishing independence and upholding equity and justice are values that our Party holds dear. They determine the basic principles that #China's diplomacy must uphold.
The pursuit of happiness for the people and of renewal of the nation is the original aspiration of the Party. It determines the responsibilities and duties of #China's diplomacy.
#China's diplomacy is conducted under the #CPC leadership for the benefit of our people. The CPC is the backbone for the Chinese people and the anchor of China's diplomacy.
#China and #Russia will set an example of strategic mutual trust, an example of mutually beneficial cooperation, an example of people-to-people connectivity, and an example of equity and justice.
The two sides will carry forward the spirit of friendship and win-win cooperation embodied by the Treaty, keep up the momentum, generate new dynamism, and further expand, broaden and deepen the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.
Our two countries have agreed to renew the treaty and make it more relevant in the new era. This is a milestone in China-Russia relations and, more importantly, a new starting point.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Treaty of Good-neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation between #China and #Russia.
This is both an experience gained from history and an imperative under the current circumstances.
The more unstable the world is, the greater the need for carrying forward China-russia cooperation. #China and #Russia should be each other's strategic support, development opportunity, and global partner.
In the face of the once-in-a-century pandemic, #China and #Russia have stood shoulder to shoulder and worked closely to combat both the coronavirus and the political virus. China and Russia standing together will remain a pillar of world peace and stability.
The legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people shall be upheld.
We stood firm against hegemony, highhandedness and bullying, and rejected outright interference in #China's domestic affairs. China's sovereignty is not to be infringed upon, and the dignity of the Chinese nation is not to be trifled with.
A compassionate, committed and responsible #China that stands by principles will bring more warmth and hope to the world and lend more confidence and strength to the pursuit of development for all.
The most demanding is the fight against #COVID19 on the diplomatic front. The most concerning is the safety of Chinese nationals abroad. One biggest priority is advancing global governance in the right direction.
Among #China's diplomatic endeavors over the last year, the most outstanding is head-of-state diplomacy. The most resolute is our determination to defend national interests.
Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, China's diplomatic service readily fulfilled its responsibilities to the country, the people&the world, by rising to the unprecedented challenges&playing a role befitting China's status.
The year 2020 has been a most extraordinary journey for #China and the whole world.
Solidarity means strength, and perseverance means victory. There is already light at the end of the tunnel. #China will continue to cooperate with other countries in solidarity and work tirelessly for humanity's final victory against this pandemic.
State Councilor & FM Wang Yi: The global fight against #COVID19 must not stop until the virus gets eliminated in each and every country. Everyone is obligated to help those in need even when there is only one case of infection left.
Stay tuned! State Councilor & Foreign Minister Wang Yi will soon meet the press at 15:00 on the margins of the fourth session of the 13th National People's Congress. He will take questions from the press on #China's diplomacy and foreign relations.  
#China's incredible growth curve.  
 
#Spring has arrived across #China. Cherry blossoms await visits in #Wuhan.  
Over 6 percent: #China sets its 2021 growth target. Different from "about" in previous years, "over" means 6 percent is the bottom line. The target will enable us to devote full energy to promoting reform, innovation, and high-quality development.  
These are voices for justice. Facts speak the loudest and justice will always prevail.
Another 20-plus countries have also spoken out separately in support of #China's stances and measures on affairs related to the #HKSAR.
The Republic of #Belarus, on behalf of 70 countries, voiced support for #China's implementation of "one country, two systems" in the #HKSAR at the #UN HRC, urging earnest respect for China's sovereignty and opposing interference in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs.
Dr. Robert Kuhn gave his reasons why #2021TwoSessions reaches a high level of importance. He highlighted the role of CPPCC, which exercises democratic supervision and provides consultation with first-rate experts in various fields as delegates.   
#China's 14th Five-Year Plan is undergoing deliberation in the National People's Congress. Check out some important remarks by Chinese President on future development.  
Two members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (#CPPCC) with deafness and hearing loss performed March of the Volunteers, China's #NationalAnthem, in #SignLanguage at today's opening of the CPPCC's annual session.  Behold the power beyond words!  
For seven years, prior to the annual "#TwoSessions", an online initiative called  "A Word to the Premier" solicits public feedback on government work to further improve public policies. Beijingers are now interviewed for their expectations for this year.  
Rukyam Makisad, a 25-year-old #Uyghur lady, one of the youngest lawmakers in #China, stresses women's employment and independence. Regarded as a daughter or a sister, she can talk with locals to find out and seek to solve people's life issues.  
 
The Lowy Institute: Almost one in five #Chinese Australians have been physically threatened or attacked in the past year because of their heritage. This highlights an urgent need for the #Australian government to counter #racism.  
High-resolution #Mars images sent back from the #Tianwen1 probe.  
Thank you, Mr. Minister, for sharing the information. In #solidarity, we will bring life back to normal soon.
 
 
 
 
 
Here comes: Things you need to know about this year's #TwoSessions.  
The #Philippines launched its #COVID19 vaccination drive on March 1. Health workers, soldiers, police and government officials received donated #Chinese jabs. "It kindles hope that, after nearly a year in darkness, the light is back on," said presidential spokesman Harry Roque.  
Good News! #China was the biggest source of applications for international patents in the world in 2020 for the second consecutive year.
The 3rd vol. of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China is to be released in 17 countries—Albania, Poland, Romania, Belarus, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Nepal, Laos, Bangladesh, Thailand, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan & Mongolia—in their respective languages.  
And none other than Adrian Zenz, whose background as a far-right extremist and a data manipulator, guilty of statistical fraud never came into the picture. So, this is what's happening across the West.
And the Lower House in #Canada's parliament has just voted unanimously to accuse #China of "genocide". Who testified in those hearings? Almost all of the people brought to testify were Uygur exiles sponsored by the #US government and cultivated by the US government.  
And the data manipulation that he employs to advance a biased claim and arrive at a conclusion which the #US government or hardline elements within it are seeking in order to block diplomacy with #China.  
...not authored by someone who has ever been to the region he claims expertise in and who is not even a #China scholar with any record of China's scholarship. It's unclear if they even speak Chinese.
It's remarkable that this incendiary and very consequential claim of "genocide" is based on research that is not carried out in an academic setting, not published in an academic journal,...  
Quotes as follows: It's unfortunate that none of the media organizations or the #US government, or even his own fact-checkers managed to check this.  
What's behind extremist Adrian Zenz's report & "genocide" lies? Exclusive interview with Max Blumenthal, editor-in-chief of Grayzone.  
It is a mockery of and shame for the independence and freedom the West claims to champion.
Urgent need for explicit definition of fake news/disinformation. The witnesses called to testify by the #US and #Canada are US-sponsored Uyghurs in exile and fake experts on #China. They barely know anything about China and even have never been to China.
Why have they delayed visit to #Xinjiang time and again under various pretexts? Because they are afraid to see the real Xinjiang, which is totally different from what they imagined.
#China welcomes people from all over the world to visit #Xinjiang, including the #UN High Commissioner for #HumanRights and #European diplomats in China. The door to Xinjiang is always open.
Dr. Fauci: If we do not completely suppress this, we will continue to be challenged by variants which have a way of coming back to bite us.  
Dr. Zhong: If the coronavirus still spreads in some individual countries, #COVID19 cannot be said to be fully controlled worldwide. We need global solidarity to end this epidemic.  
When Dr. Zhong Nanshan meets Dr. Fauci. Their consensus: solidarity and cooperation against #COVID19.  
 
#Uruguay has launched a #COVID19 vaccination campaign on March 1 following the arrival of the #Chinese vaccines. Essential workers, including teachers, military personnel, firefighters and police officers, will be inoculated first.  
Seeing is believing.  Pictures about "before & after"  #povertyalleviation in #China.  
Remember her? Zhou Chengyu, the youngest commander at the #Hainan Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site, breaks down the act of responsibility into "successfully completing the work, learning more knowledge and trying not to make mistakes".  
Beauty comes from creativity.  At the 2021 Henan #LanternFestival Gala, pottery figurines in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) were brought back to life, dancing to show the audiences around the #Henan Museum. Just like a travel back in time.  
Xu Ping is a young survivor of the grave 2008 earthquake in #Sichuan. Since election at the age of 23, she has focused on women & children's rights. Due to #COVID19, she now reacts with more people on online platforms.  
Zou Bin, 25 years old, is a construction worker & a #NPC deputy. By talking with his fellow workers on site, he collects the group's genuine concerns&suggestions. To better fulfill his duty, he tried hard to be more outgoing.  
#China's annual #TwoSessions — the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference — will be convened this week. The young generation of lawmakers now comes to the stage.
See how the "spin doctors" in western media like #BBC made and spread deliberate misrepresentation on #China, with #Xinjiang as an example, with the words from those liars like Adrian Zenz. It's just smear campaign.  
The @WorldBank graphic shows how #China's economy has grown.  In 2020 despite #COVID19, China's GDP exceeded 100tn yuan ($15.5tn), up 2.3% and estimated to account for over 17% of the world economy. The annual GDP per capita has surpassed $10k for two consecutive years.  
 
The agreement on geographical indications between #China & the #EU will take effect on Mar 1. It is China's first comprehensive, high-level bilateral agreement on GIs. It will strengthen China-EU trade and economic cooperation, and benefit consumers and businesses on both sides.  
#Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban was vaccinated against #COVID19 with #Chinese vaccine.  Thanks for the trust.

Quotes of #Chinese President's speech at the gathering to mark accomplishments in poverty eradication.  
#Guangzhou's sky was decorated with pictures made up of 500 drones yesterday on the #LanternFestival, expressing our thoughts for national heroes.  
Beautiful #spring days starts from  the southern parts in #China.  
The #LanternFestival is celebrated all over #China today, which concludes the #ChineseNewYear holiday.   Just share a few snapshots in #Xinjiang.  
Poverty eradication is and always has been a goal and a basic right of all peoples in their pursuit of a happy life.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
#China honored role models in the poverty eradication campaign. A total of 10 individuals and 10 collective units have been awarded national honorary titles for their contributions. About half of the honorees come from or serve ethnic minority groups. Check out their stories:  
Shaking off poverty is not the finish line, but the starting point of a new life and new endeavor.
#China has created a "China example" of #povertyreduction and made great contributions to global #povertyalleviation.
As long as we adhere to the Party's leadership, we can surely defeat any difficulties on our march forward.
#China will attach greater importance to the pursuit of common prosperity.
#China upholds a people-centered philosophy of development and unswervingly pursues prosperity for all.
The whole nation was mobilized to pool strength in the fight against poverty.
#China leverages the political advantages of the country's socialist system which can bring together the resources necessary to accomplish great tasks.
#China has cultivated the spirit of #povertyalleviation, which is an amalgamation of patriotism, collectivism and socialism.
The key to governance of a country is to improve its people's lives. Chinese history reflects our journey and history fighting against #poverty.
#China has scored a "complete victory" in its fight against poverty.  Chinese President announced at the  grand gathering to mark the country's accomplishments in #povertyalleviation and honor its model poverty fighters.
However, genocide actually happened in #US. During the Westward Expansion about 100 years after the country was founded, native #Indians were expelled and slaughtered. Their population dwindled from 5 million to 250k, less than one twentieth of the original number.
Allegations of "genocide" and "forced labor" in #Xinjiang are lies of the century. Xinjiang's Uyghur population more than doubled in the past 40 years. Have you ever seen this kind of genocide?   
#TouchingMoment Chinese President bowed to present the award to 98-year-old Xia Sen, who lived frugally after retirement to save for education in poor&rural areas. She has donated over 2 mln yuan and her scholarship has funded 182 students to realize their "college dream".  
Chinese #vaccines have arrived in #Thailand, #Bolivia and #Mozambique, and welcomed by the leaders at the local airports.  
These "witnesses" have raked their brains for lies and acted as tools to serve certain countries' motives to hurt #Xinjiang's security&stability and contain #China's development. They  will never succeed.  
It's not that certain countries are incapable of making rational&facts-based judgement. Facts&truth about the real situation in #Xinjiang are there for all to see. But more often than not, they choose not to. They just cherry pick&twist facts to support what they want to believe.  
Some countries, citing "testimonies" of a handful of "witnesses", conclude that #Xinjiang has gravely violated #humanrights. The thing is that Xinjiang has 25,000,000 people! Lies of these few "witnesses" can not & should not override voices of the 25 million people in Xinjiang.
The purpose of the visit is to enhance bilateral exchange and cooperation rather than carry out “investigations” with the presumption of guilt. We firmly oppose any political maneuvers to press #China on this matter.
We welcome the High Commissioner for #HumanRights to visit #Xinjiang. #China already extended invitation to the High Commissioner and both sides have been in communication on that.
At the high-level segment of the 46th session of the @UN_HRC, State Councilor Wang Yi reiterated that the door to #Xinjiang is always open.
Anyone that has been to #Xinjiang would agree that what they saw and experienced there is entirely different from some Western media reports.
The #UK has spread disinformation and smeared #China at the UN Human Rights Council. We firmly reject.
#GreenChina More than 4 million kWh of electricity was generated in 2020 by the solar panels installed on the roof of a metro depot in #Shanghai. This amount of energy can allow an eight-cabin metro train to run 200,000 kilometers.  
Q: How did #China identify 98.99 million impoverished people in a population of 1.4 billion? A: Targeted #povertyalleviation.  
Seeing is believing.  Foreign friends are welcome to visit #Xinjiang. Anybody with an objective and just view can see its economic & social development.  
Moments captured from daily life in #Xinjiang.  
#Tianwen1 probe entered the parking orbit above #Mars early this morning. It will run in the orbit for about 3 months for scientific exploration.  
 
Please see the attachment for the full text of the translation of the consensus：   
Over 310 leaders&prominent personages representing more than 190 political parties&organizations from 80 plus countries, among which over 100 are from Islamic countries, have been involved in an in-depth discussion on the theme of "A Better Life for All"&reached broad consensus.
Again, #Canada demonstrated what is indeed #humanrights hypocrite. PEOPLE are what human rights are all about. Human rights should not be a monopoly by a small number of countries, still less be used as a tool to smear at and interfere in other countries internal affairs.
So ironic. These men have never been to #Xinjiang. While the so-called Xinjiang "genocide" only exists in their imagination, genocide did actually take place in their own country during the 1870s.
Astonished that Canada's parliament passed motion accusing #China of "genocide" in #Xinjiang. Even the #US media has revealed that the genocide charges are based on data abuse, sheer fabrication & distortion.  
In the eyes of these big names: a review of China-US cultural and people-to-people exchanges in various areas since #PingPongDiplomacy in 1970s.  
Aynur Haniwa, mother of two sons, started from scratch to run her own restaurant and has done good business. #RealLifeInXinjiang  
#Vaccination consolidates the strong defense against #COVID19. The mass roll-out has begun in #Beijing and will soon take place in #HKSAR.  
This is what moon soil brought back by #ChengE5 looks like. China's space industry is called on to further innovative development and make greater contributions to the peaceful use of outer space.  
State Councilor & Foreign Minister Wang Yi: A People-centered Approach for Global Human Rights Progress  
Director Yang Jiechi: Firmly Uphold and Practice Multilateralism and Build a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind  
Children can't have too many red envelopes. And this time a really special one. Containing masks and #COVID19 prevention instructions, it helps the pupils get well-prepared for the new semester.

Righting the Wrongs and Committing to Mutual Respect and Win-win Cooperation—Speech by State Councilor Wang Yi At the Opening of Lanting Forum   
....and encourage and support the resumption of normal exchange programs between universities, research institutes and of students.
...lift restrictions on #Chinese educational & cultural groups, media outlets & institutions for overseas Chinese affairs in the #US, remove obstructions for US subnational govs and social sectors to engage with China
We hope that the #US side will act as early as possible to:  
The #Chinese and #American peoples enjoy a long-standing friendship, which should stay immune to the ups and downs in the political dimension of the relations.
The social foundation of bilateral relations was "poisoned", which should not be allowed to happen in the first place.
There are 50 pairs of sister provinces/states and 232 pairs of #sistercities. #China had been the biggest source of international students in the #UnitedStates for ten years in a row.
Fourth, it is important to clear the path for the resumption of bilateral exchanges in all areas.
As a major responsible country, #China is ready to coordinate policies and work with the #UnitedStates in these three areas for the good of the whole world.
#COVID19, #climatechange and world economic recovery are the three most pressing tasks for the international community.
....remove unreasonable tariffs on #Chinese goods, lift its unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies and research & educational institutes, and abandon irrational suppression of #China's technological progress to create necessary conditions for #China-#US cooperation.
We hope the #US side will adjust its policies as soon as possible:
Under the current circumstances, the two sides may start from easier things, interact actively, and build up goodwill.
More than ever #China and the #UnitedStates are more capable of getting big things done to the benefit of the two countries and the world at large.
Both countries gain from #cooperation and lose from #confrontation. This has been proved time and again by history and by practices since the diplomatic relationship was established.
Third, it is important to move in the same direction to restart mutually beneficial cooperation.
#China is, as always, open to dialogue. We stand ready to have candid communication with the #US side, and engage in dialogues aimed at solving problems.
This way, the two sides could get a clear understanding of each other's policy intentions, sort out the critical issues in #China-#US relations, and explore effective ways to manage sensitive issues, ward off risks and remove obstacles.
The two sides should engage in candid dialogues on a broad range of issues in bilateral relations and on major regional and international issues.
At present, both sides should follow up on the phone call between the two Presidents on the eve of the #ChineseNewYear, and reactivate or establish dialogue mechanisms in various areas and at various levels.
Given the differences between our two countries in social system, development stage, history and culture, it is natural for us to have disagreements. What is crucial is to enhance mutual understanding through dialogue and not allow our relations to be defined by disagreements.
Second, it is important to step up dialogue and properly manage the differences.
Only with true mutual respect can #China-#US relations achieve steady improvement and growth in the long run.
We urge the #US to stop smearing the CPC&China's  political system, stop conniving at or supporting the erroneous words&actions of separatist forces for "Taiwan independence", and stop undermining China's sovereignty&security on internal affairs concerning #HK, #Xinjiang& #Tibet.
We have no intention to challenge or replace the #UnitedStates. We are ready to have peaceful coexistence and seek common development with the United States. Likewise, we hope the United States will respect #China's core interests, national dignity, and rights to development.
#China has all along respected the choices made by the American people, welcomed the strong growth momentum of the #UnitedStates, and never interfered in its internal affairs.
Such attempts have not succeeded, and never will. They will only cause problems and even conflicts unnecessarily.
For major countries like #China and the #UnitedStates, there is a greater need to respect each other, rather than being fixated on remodeling, suppressing or even defeating the other.
A good-mannered gentleman never thrusts his knife and fork into the food on someone else's plate.
First, it is important to respect each other and not to interfere in each other's internal affairs.
We must, with the sense of responsibility for the two countries and the world, make once again the sensible and right decision.
We hope that #US policy makers will keep pace with the time, see clearly the trend of the world, abandon biases, give up unwarranted suspicions, and move to bring the #China policy back to reason to ensure a healthy and steady development of China-U.S. relations.
The new #US administration is reviewing and assessing its foreign policy.
We believe that all countries are equal, regardless of their size. And we firmly promote greater #democracy in international relations. We never seek to form small circles targeted at other countries. We never take actions unilaterally outside the authorization by the #UN.  
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the restoration of China’s lawful seat at the #UnitedNations. During these five decades, #China has upheld the purposes and principles of the #UNCharter, supported the UN in exercising its authority and playing its due role.
#China is a country that always practices and upholds #multilateralism.
#China is fostering a new development paradigm, advancing #openingup at a higher level. This means a bigger market and more development opportunities for other countries.
#China has hosted international import expos for three years to share with other countries the #Chinese market opportunities.  
We believe in shared interests and common good. We help fellow developing countries with sincerity and good faith, and we do not attach political strings or impose our wills.
#China is a country that always advocates and pursues #winwin cooperation.
We didn't provoke any war or occupy one inch of foreign territory. We have no intention to export ideology. Nor do we attempt to overturn the government of any country.
#China has benefited from world #peace in its development, and has contributed to world peace in turn with its development.
#China is a country that always values and safeguards world #peace.
In fighting #COVID19, we have made the utmost efforts to protect the right to life and health for each and every #Chinese, and at all cost, we have curbed the spread of the #virus in the fastest possible speed, and have done our best to raise the cure rate.
In the past 60 years and more, #Xinjiang's #GDP expanded by over 200 times, with per capita GDP growing by nearly 40 times. And its average life expectancy increased from 30 to 72.
Places inhabited by ethnic minorities, such as #Xinjiang and #Tibet, have stood out as shining examples of #China's #humanrights progress.
More than 800 million people have been lifted out of #poverty. We have eliminated abject poverty for the first time in #China's thousands years of history.
Over the past 70 plus years since the founding of the People's Republic, #China's per capita #GDP has risen from less than US $30 to over US $10,000.
We believe that the rights to subsistence and #development are basic #humanrights of paramount importance. At the same time, we strive for comprehensive and coordinated development of economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights.
#China is a country that is always committed to protecting and promoting #humanrights.
Facts have shown that #China's socialist #democracy embodies the will of the people and fits the country's realities. It is thus endorsed by the people, and has made special, important contributions to the progress of political civilization of humankind.
For example, when drafting the 14th Five-year Plan, the Chinese government placed importance on the views from various sectors, and collected over one million comments and recommendations from online channels alone.
It is the most representative #democracy where people's matters are widely consulted for the greatest common denominator that suits the will of the whole society.
It is a whole-process #democracy. Important legislation and policy-making must go through set procedures and extensive discussions, and the final decision must be made on the basis of scientific and democratic deliberations.
True #democracy must be rooted in the realities of a country and serve its people. The socialist democracy practiced by #China upholds the organic unity of the leadership of the Communist Party of China (#CPC), the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance.
#Democracy is a common value of #humanity. There are various ways to realize democracy, and there is no fixed model or standard answer.
#China is a country that always upholds and promotes people's democracy.
Today, to right the wrongs and bring the relationship back to the right track, the walls of misperceptions must be torn down first to clear the way for knowing, observing, and understanding #China as it is.  
The root cause was that the previous #US administration, out of its own political needs, seriously distorted #China's future path and policy, and on that basis, took various measures to suppress and contain China, which inflicted immeasurable damage to bilateral relations.
In the past few years, #China-#US relations deviated from the normal track, and ran into the biggest difficulties since the establishment of diplomatic ties.
This very important phone call has oriented #China-#US relations that had been struggling to ascertain its bearings at a crossroads. It has also sent out the first encouraging news of this spring for the two countries and the whole world.
On the Lunar #NewYear's eve, President Xi Jinping and President #JoeBiden had their first telephone call.
As two major countries, #China and #US should first take care of their own stuff and at the same time, they should also work together for the common good of humankind. This is the expectation of the intl community and the due responsibility of major countries.
#Humanity must not lose confidence facing the unprecedented common challenges of the global #pandemic, economic recession and #climatechange. We must stand up to them with courage, solidarity and responsibility.  
The change of seasons shows that the chills of winter will eventually melt away and the hopes of spring are just around the corner.

Spring Festival Gala for the Year of the Ox:  
The two Presidents agreed that their phone conversation today will send a positive signal to the world and the two sides will maintain close communication on China-US relations and issues of mutual interest.
The US side is prepared to have candid and constructive dialogue with the Chinese side in the spirit of mutual respect and to improve mutual understanding and avoid miscommunication and miscalculation.
President Biden noted that China has a long history and a great culture and the Chinese people are a great people. The United States and China must avoid conflict and we may work together on climate change and many other issues.
The two sides should act to conform to the trend of the world, jointly safeguard peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and make historic contributions to promoting world peace and development.
President Xi Jinping emphasized that confronting a highly uncertain international situation, China and the United States shoulder special international responsibilities and obligations as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
The Taiwan question and issues relating to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, etc. are China's internal affairs and concern China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the US side should respect China's core interests and act prudently.
It is important to manage differences where they exist and jointly pursue cooperation where it is desirable to do so.
The two sides should re-establish the various dialogue mechanisms, read each other's policy intentions accurately, and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation.
President Xi Jinping emphasized that while the two sides may differ on some issues, it is crucial to show mutual respect, treat each other as equals, and properly manage and handle the differences in a constructive fashion.
We can make our due contribution to fighting the #COVID19 pandemic, promoting world economic recovery and maintaining regional peace and stability."
"You have said that America can be defined in one word: Possibilities. We hope the possibilities will now point toward an improvement of China-US relations in this way.
President Xi emphasized that the China-US relationship is currently at an important juncture. It is the common desire of both peoples and the wider international community to see the sound and stable development of China-US relations.
President Xi Jinping took a phone call from President Joseph R. Biden of the United States of America. The two Presidents wished each other good fortune in the Year of the Ox.
Xi once again congratulated Biden on his inauguration as U.S. president, and wished the Chinese and American people a happy and auspicious Year of the Ox.
In a phone conversation between the two leaders, Biden extended greetings to the Chinese people and wished the Chinese people happiness and good fortune in the New Year.

More quality products from Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) on shelves and tables in #China. This is the way how practical cooperation delivers tangible benefits to people on both sides.
#China CDC has unveiled two new disinfectants for low-temperature sterilization, mainly to prevent #COVID19 spread via cold-chain products. A further step to safeguard people's health.  
Trying to find similar traits in animals in #Chinese and Western #zodiacs,  these two foreign ladies dove into the Chinese culture. As the #YearofOx is coming, they find that "strong, loyal and hardworking" echo the spirit of Chinese.   
Tradition is the new fashion, as Chinese President praised. Stitch by stitch, the Miao ethnic group in #Guizhou has been knitting their lives and communities for the better, and passing down traditional culture with their distinctive embroideries.  
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation — Keynote Speech by President Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit  
The two sides also stood firm for #multilateralism and took on global challenges together. #China-#CEEC cooperation is part and parcel of China-#EU relations, whose good progress means new opportunities for China-CEEC cooperation.
China's continued development and opening-up will inject powerful impetus into global economic recovery and growth, and broaden the horizons for #China-#CEEC cooperation.
China will continue to open its door wider, with a focus on institutional opening-up that covers rules, regulations, management & standards. We will continue our efforts to foster a business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to intl standards.
#China will quicken its pace in fostering a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other.
#China supports setting up a China-#CEEC dialogue mechanism on e-commerce cooperation and a China-CEEC alliance in the public health industry.
To enhance green development, we may take the #China-#CEEC Year of Green Development and Environmental Protection as an opportunity to deepen exchange and cooperation in green economy, clean energy and other related areas.
We need to jointly implement the #ParisAgreement and contribute to the success of #COP26 of the #UN Framework Convention on #ClimateChange and #COP15 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, both to be held this year.
We will hold a new round of Education Policy Dialogue and Higher Education Institutes Consortium meetings this year, and support establishing a university in #Hungary by #FudanUniversity.
We need to enhance exchange and cooperation in #culture, #education, #tourism, sports, media and press, and among think tanks, young people and sub-national entities.
China intends to import, in the coming 5 years, more than 170 bln US dollars of goods from #CEE countries. We need to deepen agricultural cooperation in a bid to double CEE countries' agricultural exports to China and raise two-way agricultural trade by 50% over the next 5 years.
We could also explore cooperation on a pilot basis under the "Smart Customs, Smart Borders and Smart Connectivity" Initiative.
#China will work toward the establishment of a #China-#CEEC customs information center and a focal point for customs clearance coordination for countries along the China-Europe Land-Sea Express Line.
So far, #Serbia has received one million doses of #vaccines from a Chinese company, and there is ongoing cooperation between #Hungary and Chinese vaccine companies. #China will actively consider such cooperation with other #CEE countries if there is the need.
Acting in an innovative&pioneering spirit, we have taken steps early on to explore the possibility of aligning cross-regional cooperation with Belt&Road cooperation, making Central&Eastern Europe the 1st region where all countries have signed agreements on Belt&Road cooperation.
#China and #CEE countries share the conviction that #openness brings opportunities and #inclusiveness ensures diversity. This is the key to the sustained vibrancy of China-CEEC cooperation.
Impressive progress has been made in a number of cooperation projects, including the Port of #Piraeus in #Greece, the Smederevo Steel Plant in #Serbia, and the Peljesac Bridge in #Croatia.
Today, trade between #China and #CEE countries is nearly 85 percent bigger than 9 years ago. The number of mutual tourist visits has grown nearly five times. The China-Europe Railway Express has reached most of the CEE countries, running more than 30,000 freight services so far.
Mindful of each other's concerns, we have drawn up plans and decided on projects based on the national reality of each country, and encouraged all countries to find the best way to leverage their respective strengths in cooperation.
Guided by the conviction that "17 plus 1 could make more than 18", we have set up a multi-dimensional cooperation framework led by the leaders' summit and covering 20-plus sectors to ensure the participation of all #CEE countries.
#China-#CEEC cooperation is based on mutual respect and has no political strings attached. All countries involved, regardless of their size, are equal partners in a cooperation mechanism featuring extensive #consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits.
The principles are: making decisions through #consultation, delivering benefits to all cooperation partners, pursuing common development through #openness and #inclusiveness, and achieving bigger growth through #innovation.
The #China-#CEEC cooperation has developed some principles that are reflective of its distinctive features and accepted by all parties.

Chinese President's congratulatory message to 34th #AUsummit:
Making Tofu Day. To prepare for the essential dish on the #SpringFestival eve.  #Tofu, a long-time material for #Chinese festive and daily cuisine, has gained worldwide popularity.  
Road building is the first step out of poverty. Then follow tourism and cultivation. This is the way this village of the ethnic Miao people transformed their life for the better. A part of China's overall effort for rural revitalization.  
#Mars ahead! Here comes the first image of Mars captured by #Tianwen1 2.2million km away from the planet.  Amazing!  
House Cleaning Day of #SpringFestival ( Chinese New Year) season today. A big cleaning should be done to welcome the New Year. All vessels, curtains, beddings and every corner need to be cleaned. In Chinese, cleaning the dust means driving away the old things.  
Defrauding, smuggling, lying, even cheating her own sister, but awarded by the big liar for her "courage". What a shame! It is time to tell the true story.  
Fact Check: Lies on #Xinjiang-related issues versus the truth  
#BBC's so-called "witnesses" & "testimonies" have been proven repeatedly to be ACTORS & LIES. Smart&responsible media will not keep making such stupid mistakes, unless it deliberately keeps making fake news and spreading disinformation!
@Ofcom's decision to revoke CGTN's license is purely out of ideological bias and political motives, instead of facts. We urge the #UK to correct its mistake. #China will take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights&interests of the Chinese media.
@CGTN, as a well-established, awards-studded and internationally recognized broadcaster, has strictly complied with British laws&regulations and followed professional ethics.
#Olympic torch unveiled for #Beijing 2022.  
#China, Central and Eastern #Europe foreign trade exceeded $100b for first time in 2020, grow by 8.4%. Very good news!
BBC should show evidence or admit to rumormonger.  
The #IOC President Bach: I extend our great satisfaction with the state of preparation, because despite of the #pandemic, all the venues are ready one year before (the Winter Games). I think that's a great example of #Chinese dynamism, determination and efficiency.  
 
We encourage all countries, with the capacity to do so, to engage actively & support WHO in building #COVAX together, and ensure timely vaccine access for the developing world.
China attaches great importance to WHO DG Tedros' call to vaccinate priority populations in all nations within the first 100 days of this year, and has decided to provide 10 million doses of vaccines to #COVAX to primarily meet the urgent need of developing countries.

She no longer migrates but works at home with the help from her village and targeted poverty alleviation policy. With an annual income of 100,000 yuan, her family successfully shakes off poverty.  
And he is glad to see this mother of Yi ethnic minority is living a new life. In a new house, she no longer worries about roof crushing or leaking. With new roads & high-speed railways, traveling time from her home to her previous workplace is down from 3 days to several hours.  
For all these years, the photographer has been trying to find her, to see how she is doing now.  
This picture taken 11 years ago during the #SpringFestival travel season at a train station. It struck people's eyes as the young mother taking her child home with the weight of supporting her family on her back.  
The #SpringFestival is around the corner! Red lanterns heighten the atmosphere and earn more income for the workers of the #povertyalleviation lantern company in #Shanxi.

In a locked down village in #Hebei Province, volunteers help disinfect public areas, deliver supplies and pay gas bills. Dissuaded from going out, villagers understand that unity and temporary sacrifice will bring victory.  
#Chunyun, China's #SpringFestival travel rush, kicked off yesterday. For a happy holiday season, as well as the public's safety and health, stringent #COVID19 precautions will not be let up.

Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity's Way Forward -- Special Address by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda  
Let us all join hands and let #multilateralism light our way toward a community with a shared future for mankind.
We have been shown time and again that to #beggarthyneighbor, to go it alone, and to slip into arrogant isolation will always fail.
There is only one shared future for humanity. As we cope with the current crisis and endeavor to make a better day for everyone, we need to stand united and work together.
It pursues friendly and cooperative relations with other countries and will contribute to the endeavor of developing countries to #eradicatepoverty, ease debt burden, and achieve more growth.
#Zerosum game or #winnertakesall is not the guiding philosophy of the Chinese people. #China is a staunch follower of an independent foreign policy of peace.
#China will continue to promote a new type of #internationalrelations.
We will work with other countries to create an #open, #fair, #equitable and #nondiscriminatory environment for scientific and technological advancement that is beneficial to all and shared by all.
Scientific and technological advances should benefit all humanity rather than be used to curb and contain other countries' development. #China will think and act with more #openness with regard to international exchange and #cooperation on #science and #technology.
#China will continue to advance #science, #technology and #innovation.
When the interests of the entire humanity are at stake, #China must step forward, take action & get the job done. We're doing this as a concrete action to uphold #multilateralism and as a contribution to protecting our shared home & realizing #sustainabledevelopment of humanity.
#China will continue to promote #sustainabledevelopment.
As a longstanding supporter of economic #globalization, #China is committed to following through on its fundamental policy of #openingup. China will continue to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation.
It serves no one's interest to use the #pandemic as an excuse to reverse #globalization and go for seclusion and decoupling.
#China will continue to implement a #winwin strategy of #openingup.
It is especially important to scale up #cooperation on the R&D, production and distribution of #vaccines and make them public goods that are truly accessible and affordable to people in all countries.
Closer #solidarity and #cooperation, more #informationsharing, and a stronger #globalresponse are what we need to defeat #COVID19 across the world.
#China will continue to take an active part in international cooperation on #COVID19.
We need to reform and improve the #globalgovernance system on the basis of extensive #consultation and consensus-building.
We need to stand by the core values and basic principles of #multilateralism. We also need to adapt to the changing international landscape and respond to #globalchallenges as they arise.
The world is undergoing changes unseen in a century, and now is the time for major development and major transformation. To uphold #multilateralism in the 21st century, we should promote its fine tradition, take on new perspectives and look to the future.
We should stay committed to keeping up with the times instead of rejecting change.
Equal rights to development should be guaranteed for all countries to promote common #development and #prosperity. We should advocate fair competition, like competing with each other for excellence in a racing field, not beating each other on a wrestling arena.
It is important that we stick to the #cooperation concept based on mutual benefit, say no to narrow-minded, selfish #beggarthyneighbor policies, and stop unilateral practice of keeping advantages in development all to oneself.
History and reality have made it clear, time and again, that the misguided approach of #antagonism and #confrontation, be it in the form of #coldwar, #hotwar, #tradewar or #techwar, would eventually hurt all countries' interests and undermine everyone's well-being.
We should respect and accommodate differences, avoid meddling in other countries' internal affairs, and resolve disagreements through #consultation and #dialogue.
We should stay committed to consultation and cooperation instead of conflict and confrontation.
#Multilateralism should not be used as pretext for acts of #unilateralism. Principles should be preserved and rules, once made, should be followed by all. "Selective multilateralism" should not be our option.
State-to-state relations should be coordinated and regulated through proper institutions and rules. The strong should not bully the weak. Decision should not be made by simply showing off strong muscles or waving a big fist.
We should stay committed to #internationallaw and international rules instead of seeking one's own supremacy.
We should uphold the common values of humanity, i.e. #peace, #development, #equity, #justice, #democracy and #freedom, and jointly safeguard world peace and stability.
We cannot tackle common challenges in a divided world. Humanity has learned lessons the hard way, and that history is not long gone. We must not return to the path of the past.
To build small circles or start a new #ColdWar, to reject, threaten or intimidate others, to willfully impose decoupling, supply disruption or sanctions, and to create isolation or estrangement will only push the world into division and even confrontation.
#Multilateralism is about having international affairs addressed through consultation and the future of the world decided by everyone working together.
We should stay committed to openness and inclusiveness instead of closeness and exclusion.
The problems facing the world are intricate and complex. The way out of them is through upholding #multilateralism and building a community with a shared future for mankind.
No global problem can be solved by any one country alone. There must be global action, global response and global cooperation.
Public health emergencies like #COVID19 may very well recur, and global public health governance needs to be enhanced.
The fourth is to come together against global challenges and jointly create a better future for humanity.
Equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules should be strengthened, so that all countries will benefit from the opportunities and fruits of development.
The international community should provide necessary support to developing countries and safeguard their legitimate development interests.
With the growth of developing countries, global prosperity and stability will be put on a more solid footing, and developed countries will stand to benefit from such growth.
The third is to close the divide between developed and developing countries and jointly bring about growth and prosperity for all.
The right choice is for countries to pursue peaceful #coexistence based on mutual respect and on expanding common ground while shelving differences, and to promote exchanges and mutual learning. This is the way to add impetus to the progress of human civilization.
What does ring the alarm is arrogance, prejudice and hatred; it is the attempt to impose hierarchy on human civilization or to force one's own history, culture and social system upon others.
There will be no human civilization without diversity, and such diversity will continue to exist for as long as we can imagine. Difference in itself is no cause for alarm.
The best criteria are whether a country's history, culture and social system fit its particular situation, enjoy people's support, serve to deliver political stability, social progress and better lives, and contribute to human progress.
No two leaves in the world are identical, and no histories, cultures or social systems are the same. Each country is unique with its own history, culture and social system, and none is superior to the other.
The second is to abandon ideological prejudice and jointly follow a path of peaceful #coexistence, mutual benefit and #winwin cooperation.
We need to shift the driving forces and growth models of the global economy and improve its structure, so as to set the course for long-term, sound and steady development of the world economy.
We need to focus on current priorities, and balance #COVID response and economic development. More importantly, we need to look beyond the horizon and strengthen our will and resolve for change.
The first is to step up macroeconomic policy coordination and jointly promote strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth of the world economy.
Every choice and move we make today will shape the world of the future. It is important that we properly address the four major tasks facing people of our times.
The #pandemic is far from over. We must carry on the fight. Yet we remain convinced that winter can't stop the arrival of spring & darkness can never shroud the light of dawn. There is no doubt that humanity will prevail over the #virus & emerge even stronger from this disaster.
The past year was marked by the onslaught of the #COVID19 pandemic. Humanity encountered multiple crises rarely seen in human history.
President Xi Jinping is delivering a special address at the #WorldEconomicForum Virtual Event of the #DavosAgenda.
Now, after four years' time, let's expect what President Xi is going to say again at #WEF.
In Jan. 2017, President Xi Jinping expounded China's views & propositions on economic globalization in his first-ever keynote speech at the #WEF annual meeting. He famously said that  "whether you like it or not, the global economy is the big ocean you cannot escape from".
President Xi Jinping is about to deliver a special speech at the #WEF #DavosAgenda via video link at the invitation of Dr. Klaus Schwab.
.@mfa_russia We support #Russia in its actions to maintain security and stability, as this serves the interests of the Russian people.
Some #US politicians have no problem with themselves suppressing others but allow no legitimate self defenses from others. This can only be explained as the logic of bullying, hegemony and power politics.
According to data from the #US side, the #TrumpAdministration took more than 3,900 distinct sanctions actions in total, or THREE per DAY. Unilateral sanctions are like a boomerang: it is hurled against another, but will inevitably come back to harm oneself.
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between #China and #Pakistan. China and Pakistan will take this as an opportunity to jointly build an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future.#IronBrothers
During a phone call with Pakistani Foreign Minister @SMQureshiPTI yesterday, State Councilor & FM Wang Yi announced that #China will provide a batch of #vaccines as aid & will actively coordinate with the relevant Chinese enterprise to speed up export of vaccines to #Pakistan.
#US & #Russia extending #NewSTART treaty will be conducive to safeguarding global strategic stability and international peace & security. We hope the US will continue to work with Russia to ensure a successful extension of the treaty.
The complete high-speed rail linking #Beijing to Harbin was launched today. On it runs the Fuxing bullet train, the fastest runner and part of successful independent innovation of China. It cuts the trip of 1,198km to 5 hrs, and can stand the biting cold in China's icy northeast.  
2021 marks the 21st year of China's police forces' participation in #UNpeacekeeping operations. By now, more than 2,600 police officers have been sent to the missions. 8 of them laid down their lives. More than 30 still carry on their operations despite #COVID19.  
Fr. Mar. 1, 2020-Jan. 10, 2021, China has exported&donated to the US 42+ bil. masks, 900+ mil. surgical gloves, 780 mil. protective suits, 50.66 mil. goggles, 15,648 non-invasive&257 invasive ventilators. China stands ready to further deepen anti-epidemic cooperation with the US.
#China believes that Secretary General Guterres is the right person to lead #UN going forward. Together with the #internationalcommunity, we stand ready to continue with our support to the UN and Secretary General Guterres for the common cause of world peace and development.
#China speaks highly of the positive role @antonioguterres has played in leading @UN to protect world peace&security, promote sustainable development and unite all countries in the fight against the pandemic.
I am convinced that with the two sides setting our minds to it and making joint efforts, the "better angels" in #China_US relations can surely overcome the evil forces.
Pre. Biden said the US "has too much to heal&much to restore". #China_US relations also have too many mines, burned bridges&destroyed roads waiting to be cleared, rebuilt&repaired. We just need to show courage&wisdom, hear one another, see one another&show respect to one another.
As President #Biden said, democracy allows disagreement and disagreement must not lead to disunion. Countries with different social systems, cultural backgrounds and ideologies should and are fully able to coexist in harmony and engage in dialogue&cooperation.
"A new day for #US", as said by American media. We wish the same for #China_US relations. The past 4 years have seen so many lies, hatred&division sown by certain anti-China politicians. The two peoples have suffered & hope to see ties return to the right track at an early date.
Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Announces Sanctions on Pompeo and Others:  
A volunteer's day in #Shijiazhuang. The #virus only makes communities more close-knit. When looking out for each other, ordinary people become heroes.  
Thorough preparation underway — for athletes' best performance in 2022 #BeijingOlympic and Paralympic Winter Games,  and for wider public participation in winter sports.  
In Kekeya, a little-known place in Aksu, Northwest #Xinjiang, a "Green Great Wall" has been gradually erected thanks to the united efforts of local people of different ethnic groups, shoulder to shoulder, generation by generation. Now the desert became forest. A man-made miracle.  
Neglecting facts but sowing lies reveals #Pompeo's true intent to interfere in China's internal affairs, undermine China's stability&contain China's development. Justice may be late, but it will catch up. Pompeo&his lies will find a comfortable place in the dustbin of history.
#Pompeo's lies are an affront to the 1.4 billion Chinese people including 25 million #Xinjiang residents & to the intelligence of the American people and the international community. He has betrayed & challenged the basic moral standard & human conscience.
The life expectancy of #Xinjiang residents grew from 30 to 72 over the past 60 years or so. The Uyghur population increased by 25.04% from 2010-2018, much higher than the 2% growth rate of the Han population.
In 2019, #Xinjiang received 200+ million domestic & foreign travelers. They saw with their own eyes how beautiful Xinjiang is & how people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang enjoy unity, harmony & happiness.
"China committing genocide & crimes against humanity in #Xinjiang" only exists in #Pompeo's ugly political conspiracies. It has never happened and will never happen in our country!
#Pompeo's so-called determination is NULL & VOID. Not worth the paper it's written on. Because he is so NOTORIOUS for LYING & CHEATING. Btw, he is INDEED successful in making himself "the Clown of the Century"!
From a "barren land" to a veritable "oasis" with  forests now covering 56% of the total land area from just 0.3%. This is what has been achieved over the past 60 years in Youyu County, Shanxi province, through persistence and hard work. #GreenChina  
Summary of #China's economic performance in 2020, the difficult year.  
China-Russia strategic coordination serves as an anchor for stability in a chaotic world. No limit nor forbidden zone exists for bilateral cooperation, as we elevate it from its high level to go further&deeper, thus contributing to global strategic stability&fairness&justice.
@mfa_russia China highly appreciates FM Lavrov's remarks on China-Russia relations at the annual press conference. Remarkable achievements have been made as the two sides withstand the test of the #pandemic & unprecedented changes together.
Still remember his brilliant remarks at the #WEF in Jan. 2017: "Whether you like it or not, the global economy is the big ocean that you cannot escape from." & "Pursuing #protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room." Looking forward to hearing more on Jan.25.
President Xi Jinping will attend the #WEF's #DavosAgenda on Jan. 25 in #Beijing via video link.
 
How is China's #Shijiazhuang fighting against #COVID19?  
The Chinese side has published a series of reality checks on #COVID19, debunking falsehoods with solid figures&facts. The US government's dismissal of truth precisely reveals the fact that for some US politicians, lies are "facts" as long as they serve to attack and smear China.
The theories in this so-called "fact" sheet are self-contradictory and cannot bear closer look. Almost all top scientists&disease control experts, including American experts, have openly rejected such theories.
The fact sheet regarding WIV posted by the @StateDept is filled with conspiracy theories and lies. There are no science nor facts to support their theories that the novel coronavirus comes from a lab&WIV has a secret military background.
#China calls on the #US to heed the concerns of the international community and make real efforts to uphold global strategic stability as well as peace and security in the region and beyond.
@mfa_russia The #US unilateral withdrawal from the #OpenSkiesTreaty, which has severely hurt trust&transparency mil-to-mil, directly led to #Russia formally exiting the treaty. Russia's efforts to save the treaty were not echoed by the US and other signatories.
A hard-earned achievement and another milestone of #China's economy: GDP exceeded 100 trillion yuan for the 1st time in 2020(≈US$15.42 trillion). The per capita disposable income rose 2.1% to 32,189 yuan, basically keeping pace with the GDP growth rate. And more.  
80,000+ delivery personnel in Beijing have been vaccinated against #COVID19. They ensure our needs are met. Many will stick to their posts during the Chinese New Year, away from their own families at a time of reunion. The holiday will be happy thanks to them.  
In Geneva 2017, President Xi called for building a community with a shared future for mankind. The vision has gradually transformed into a global consensus and is more relevant in the world facing growing challenges.  
Some experts of China's Lunar Exploration Program (CLEP) and foreign representatives were interviewed by Chinese and foreign media.  
The international partners of #ChangE5 Lunar Exploration Program were presented with commemoration plaques. China's "Procedures for Requesting Lunar Sample" was published. After the event, the delegates visited the exhibition of #ChangE5 Lunar Exploration.  
Representatives from 32 countries and regional organizations participated in the activity "Access to China's Lunar Exploration" in National Astronomical Observatories on the morning of January 18 in Beijing.  
With China forecast to drive around one-third of global growth over the next decade, maintaining market access to China is increasingly essential for US businesses' global success.
According to USCBC report: The trade war had resulted in an estimated peak loss of 245,000 jobs. Escalating trade tensions and significant decoupling with China would hurt the US economy further and reduce employment.  
Look! Best Performance of "Last-Day Madness"!  
Local passengers cheered as #Chinese new subway cars started operation in #US #Boston:

People in #Beijing receiving first doses of #COVID19 vaccines in Chaoyang Park, one of the 205 vaccination sites in BJ. By 5pm today, BJ has administered a total of 1.6+ million doses. In the darkness of the pandemic, hope never fades away.  
 
Children of Gulang County, #Gansu Province in northwest #China now enjoy their new schools. It is part of the relocation project to shake off extreme poverty there. Public housing and hospitals were built as well. New homes brought new life.  
#China stayed as the largest trading nation of goods in 2020. The performance of e-commerce and private businesses were especially impressive. As China opens up further, its huge market and favorable business environment mean more opportunities to the world.  
The #US both creates lies and takes egregious actions based on its lies to violate intl trade rules and principles of market economy, undermine global industrial and value chains, and damage the interests of companies and consumers all over the world including those in the US.

"Forced labor" is the biggest lie of the century aimed to restrict and suppress the relevant Chinese authorities and companies and contain China's development.

Stay strong, as always! We are all in this together.
#Wuhan is still in memory. At the height of the pandemic, the city received much-needed supplies from across the country. Now as new cases are reported in #Shijiazhuang, Wuhan reciprocates with vegetables, volunteers, medical teams and CT scanner trucks.  
The future is in sight. Chinese scientists have set up an integrated quantum network that combines 700 fiber and two ground-to-satellite links, and realized quantum key distribution between more than 150 users over a combined distance of 4,600 km.  
A picture is worth a thousand words.  Fighting #COVID19, a memory that will not be forgotten.  
No country can achieve long-term development by exploiting chaos in other countries. The #US should try to make itself a better country & #China will surely become its better self.
This shows that even in the #US, freedom is not limitless & there's a price to pay for abusing it. Then why should things unacceptable in the US be acceptable in #HK?

On the occasion of the 46th anniversary of China-Botswana diplomatic relations, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited #Botswana and signed a MoU on #BRI cooperation, making Botswana the 46th African country inking BRI cooperation documents with #China.  
Thank you, Mr. #Pompeo, for this vivid lesson. Thanks to it, we #Chinese cherish our life & love our country even more. We are also more convinced that the path we've chosen is correct.
The #US shall pay a heavy price for its wrong actions.
A handful of anti-China politicians in the #US have been staging a final show of madness. They'll stop at nothing to sabotage China-US relations for selfish gains. Such acts will surely be punished by history.
We hope the #American people could regain their #peace, stability & #safety ASAP.

ドキュメンタリー「ポスト・パンデミック時代」は中国の並々ならぬ努力をありのままに伝えました。竹内亮監督、ありがとう! @RyoTakeuchi2333
Thank you, Mr Takeuchi Ryo @RyoTakeuchi2333, for documenting "The Post-pandemic Era". Amazing record of China's extraordinary experience.   
One cannot but marvel at the unfathomable self-confidence & courage of US @StateDept in carrying out  its "lying diplomacy". Let facts speak for themselves.  
Using human rights as a pretext to interfere in others' internal affairs is a great travesty & mockery of human rights.
The Chinese government's commitment to #HumanRights remains firm while U.S. politicians' slogans quickly fade away. With more than 20 million confirmed cases & 350k deaths in the US, have they shown any grief or done anything to help?
#HumanRights are concrete & tangible, not just an empty slogan. The most basic human right is the right to life. Amid the pandemic, that means the right & freedom to stay safe & sound.
This comprehensive, balanced & high-level agreement is a landmark in China-EU trade cooperation & a win for multilateralism. It will help boost world economic recovery.
.@SecPompeo claims the China-EU investment deal doesn't protect European workers, then is the US protecting European workers by slapping tariffs on European products?
These are indeed shining examples of humanity's kindness & sincerity even in this cold winter.
Grateful for Senior Constable Kelly Foster's admirable bravery & deeply mourn her passing. A joint rescue mission by Chinese & American expedition teams helped save a member of the Australian mission in Antarctica in Dec. last year.
China is the only nuclear-weapon state that has unconditionally committed itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones. Can the #US make such a commitment?
Though claiming itself to be the beacon of #freedom and #democracy, it shows littile respect for people's lives. This is exactly where our value diverges.
The LYING DIPLOMACY of @SecPompeo and US @StateDept has taught the world that lies have vast and terrible consequences on its reputation and image.
"SoReal", China's 1st #VR theme park combining #5G and Extended Reality opened on New Year's Day in #Guangxi, quite a special gift for local people and tourists. Experience there tells how magic the technology can be.  
#Beijing's blue sky today.  As just officially released, Beijing saw more days (276/365) with good air quality and a record-low PM2.5 density in 2020.  
Since 1991, #Africa has been the destination for Chinese foreign ministers' 1st overseas visit each year. State Councilor&Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit this time is a continuation of the tradition, demonstrating the high importance China attaches to its relations with Africa.
China respects the sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction enjoyed by the #Arctic States and takes an active part in the international governance of the Arctic.
The Arctic is facing non-traditional security challenges such as threats to its ecological environment and marine pollution, which requires concerted efforts by all.
Then why do #US military vessels and aircraft frequently carry out exercises and close-in reconnaissance in the #SouthChinaSea? It is an American fiction for the US to believe that it  has the right to do whatever it wishes to do.  
.@SecPompeo The continental #UnitedStates is more than 8,300 miles from the #SouthChinaSea. Even #Hawaii is more than 5,800 miles away.  
.@SecPompeo accused China again as the threat to global peace and stability. Seriously? Who's the real threat to global peace & stability? The UNITED STATES. FOR SURE.  
This is blatant disregard of and truly disdain for #humanrights!
The right to life is the most basic #humanright. The number of confirmed cases in the #US has surpassed 20 million, with over 350,000 deaths. But has Mr. #Pompeo expressed any sympathy for all these lives lost? What has he done to save these lives?
We set up the China-Pacific Island Countries #COVID19 Response Fund & provided additional funding three times. We have provided over 1mln #masks, 100,000 #protectivegowns, 23,000 #faceshields & #goggles and is  considering to provide #vaccines in light of their needs.
Cooperation between #China & Pacific island countries has become closer since #COVID19 broke out. China initiated a video conference of health experts with 10 Pacific island countries to share experience.
The best way to keep one's lead is through constant self-improvement, not by blocking others' development.
Swedish media #DailyNews recently reported on how the #US has pressured #Sweden to exclude #Huawei from its #5G network. Another example showing it is exactly the US that has been practicing coercive diplomacy.
For 31 consecutive years, Chinese foreign ministers have chosen #Africa for their first overseas visit each year. This proves #China's sincerity & determination to support African countries.
The FIRST visit of 2021! State Councilor & FM Wang Yi is on the way to #Nigeria, #DRCongo, #Botswana, #Tanzania & #Seychelles.
The #NMPA has approved conditional marketing authorization for Sinopharm’s vaccine, a testament to its safety & efficacy. #China will continue to work with other parties to promote equitable vaccine distribution & contribute to the global fight against #COVID19.
The Chinese government places great importance on #vaccine safety & efficacy. Chinese vaccine companies have been advancing R&D in strict accordance with scientific laws & regulatory requirements.
The first mega waste-to-energy plant in #Xinjiang was put into operation. A total of 1.6 million tonnes of garbage would be burned to generate power each year, reducing standard coal consumption by 500,000 tonnes.  
Yongxing Village of Zhangjiagang city in southeast China is known for their "forest of memory". The villagers removed illegal constructions, moved old trees with them and planted more. It is the memory of environmental protection and sustainable development.  
The Three Gorges Dam set a world record in 2020 with 111.80bln KWh of power generated, equivalent to saving 34.39mln tons of standard coal and reducing emissions of CO2, SO2 & NO by 94.02mln, 224000 & 212000 tons respectively. A boon to green development & post-COVID recovery.

State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi Gives Interview To Xinhua News Agency and China Media Group On International Situation and China's Diplomacy in 2020  
We will uphold the shared values of humanity — #peace, #development, #equity, #justice, #democracy and #freedom, and work with all countries to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world of lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity.
We will continue to work for a community with a shared future for mankind. (#communitywithasharedfutureformankind)
The year 2021 will be of historic significance to #China's #nationalrejuvenation, as we will celebrate the #CPC's centenary. The centenary is just the first chapter of the Party's great cause.  
Facts abound to show the strong vitality of the #BRI. China is fostering a #newdevelopmentparadigm, which will provide stronger impetus, more opportunities and more effective pathways for Belt and Road cooperation.
The #ChinaEuropeRailwayExpress has completed more than 10,000 services in 2020. Hailed as a "steel camel fleet", it has helped countries with their #COVID19 response, brining much-needed warmth to this harsh winter in the world economy.
#COVID19 has dealt a heavy blow to the world economy. That said, instead of stalling altogether, #cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (#BRI) has bucked the trend to make new progress. It has demonstrated a strong resilience.
This is the responsibility of #China's diplomacy and the national character of the Chinese people.
We are happy to take well-intentioned criticism and go with helpful suggestions. But we have to respond to defamations and attacks. And more important, we are obliged to speak up for #justice when faced with #powerpolitics and #bullying.
We accord friends with #hospitality and partners with #cooperation. But we also have to stand our ground when dealing with those who are not so friendly.
#China's diplomacy shoulders the important responsibilities of safeguarding national interests, defending national dignity, facilitating international cooperation, and promoting #worldpeace.  
...and shoulder due responsibilities and play a constructive role in settling disputes.
As for major countries that play a key role in various #hotspotissues, we hope that instead of anyone's own selfish interests, they can bear in mind the real interests of regional countries and the well-being of all people in the world,...
Having been torn by wars and conflicts in the past, we Chinese know too well the scourge of turmoil and the value of #peace. We hope that #hotspotissues will be made to cool down and that peace talks will bring true peace.
We speak for #justice from an objective and sensible perspective. We seek solutions that suit the regional reality and accommodate the interests of all parties.
We maintain that regional disputes should be addressed through #dialogue and #consultation. We uphold non-interference in internal affairs.
#China has been exploring a distinctive Chinese way of resolving hotspot issues.
#China and #Africa will stay good brothers supporting each other, good partners pursuing common development, and good comrades-in-arms standing together through thick and thin.
In 2021, #China and #Africa will have #FOCAC meetings in #Senegal. In this context, China will work with Africa on the three priority areas of #vaccine cooperation, economic recovery and transformative development.
China-Africa friendship emerged still stronger from the test of #COVID19 in 2020.
With our shared identity as part of the developing world, #China and #Africa have the responsibility of advancing the interests of developing countries.
The 30th anniversary is a milestone for #ChinaASEAN relations. We believe that the relationship will demonstrate greater maturity and confidence in the years ahead.
#China stands ready to work with #ASEAN to further enrich our strategic partnership and usher in a new era of peace, development and cooperation for the region.
Over the years, #ChinaASEAN relations have created many "firsts". #China and #ASEAN will celebrate the 30th anniversary of their dialogue relations in 2021.
Since its launch, #ChinaASEAN cooperation has always been results-oriented, pioneering and responsive to the trend of the times. It has become the most successful and vibrant example of regional cooperation.
In this volatile and changing world, #China will remain a supporter of #Europeanintegration, greater strategic autonomy of the #EU, and a bigger role of the EU in international affairs.
President Xi Jinping and European leaders have jointly announced the conclusion of negotiations on a #ChinaEUinvestmenttreaty, adding fresh, strong impetus to #ChinaEU cooperation.
#China became the #EU's largest trading partner for the first time.
The most important mission is to jointly tackle global challenges, promote a multi-polar world, economic #globalization and greater democracy in international relations, and inject more stability and certainty into a turbulent and changing world.
Our cooperation and common understandings far outweigh competition and differences. #China and the #EU are comprehensive strategic partners, not systemic rivals.
The most important experience is to stay committed to peaceful #coexistence, open #cooperation, #multilateralism, and #dialogue and #consultation.
#Chinas relationship with the #EU has on the whole focused on dialogue.
We don't need a world where #China becomes another #UnitedStates. This is neither rational nor feasible.  Rather, the United States should try to make itself a better country, and China will surely become its better self.
We know that some in the #UnitedStates are uneasy about #China's rapid development. However, the best way to keep one's lead is through constant self-improvement, not by blocking others' development.
China-US relations have come to a new crossroads, and a new window of hope is opening. We hope that the next #US administration will return to a sensible approach, resume dialogue with #China, restore normalcy to the bilateral relations and restart #cooperation.
Such a policy will find no support and is doomed to fail.
What has happened proves that the #US attempt to suppress #China and start a new #ColdWar has not just seriously harmed the interests of the two peoples, but also caused severe disruptions to the world.
Fundamentally, it all comes down to the serious misconceptions of #US policymakers about #China. Some see China as the so-called biggest threat and their China policy based on this misperception is simply wrong.
In recent years, China-US relations have run into unprecedented difficulties.
Being each other's strategic anchor, diplomatic priority, development opportunity and global partner, the two countries will expand and deepen cooperation from a higher starting point.
In developing China-Russia strategic cooperation, we see no limit, no forbidden zone and no ceiling to how far this cooperation can go.
In 2020, China-Russia relations have stood the test of a once-in-a-century #pandemic and unprecedented global changes, and reached a historic high in all respects.
#COVID19 may have suspended flights, yet it has not hindered the solicitude of the motherland for the well-being of its sons and daughters abroad.
We have pooled every resource available and lost no time in delivering people-centered diplomacy. We have defied risks and danger to put up a firm line of defense for our fellow Chinese in every corner of the world.
The principle of for the people and by the people has been a source of strength for the #CommunistPartyofChina. It is also the defining feature of #China's diplomacy.
6⃣We were the first to pledge to make #vaccines a global public good.  To help other developing countries access affordable vaccines, we engaged in active collaboration on the R&D of drugs and vaccines.
"#MadeinChina" products became a key source of supply for the global fight against the #pandemic.
5⃣We did our best as the largest manufacturer of medical supplies.  We provided countries around the world with over 220 billion #masks, 2.25 billion #protectivesuits and over 1 billion #testingkits.
We provided assistance to over 150 countries and 10 international organizations, sent 36 medical teams to 34 countries in need and provided funding to #WHO and other relevant #UN agencies.
4⃣We provided urgently needed assistance by launching the largest global emergency humanitarian campaign since the founding of #NewChina.
3⃣We conducted the largest-scale online exchanges on #epidemic response with the support of science and technology.
2⃣We took the most rigorous control measures to fight the #virus.
1⃣We raced against time and were the first country to report cases to the world.
#China's contributions and support to the global response are best seen in the following six respects:  
#China has called for global cooperation since the start, giving meaning to the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The #coronavirus is a common enemy of humanity. To defeat it is the shared responsibility of the international community.
He laid out China's vision for #globalgovernance featuring extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and articulated China's unequivocal commitment to #multilateralism and to fairer and more equitable global governance.
President Xi Jinping has pointed the way forward for reforming the #globalgovernance system.
President Xi offered a series of proposals, including maintaining the smooth functioning of the world economy, leveraging the #DigitalEconomy, making development more inclusive and beneficial for all, and building an open world economy.
President Xi Jinping has boosted #confidence in world economic recovery.
Advocating science-based response, he called for joint efforts to enhance global prevention and control, develop #vaccines, build a strong line of defense against the #virus, and oppose politicization and stigmatization.
President Xi Jinping has championed #solidarity in the world's fight against #COVID19.
President Xi Jinping personally engaged in "#clouddiplomacy", having 87 meetings and phone calls with foreign leaders and heads of international organizations and attending 22 important bilateral or multilateral events.
But #China's diplomacy has not paused in the face of the difficulties. We have neither shied away from any challenges, nor fallen silent on any major issues.  
#COVID19, which caught everyone by surprise, has hit the “pause” button on face-to-face interactions between countries.
#China is generating global opportunities and embracing #openness and #cooperation. We will make greater contributions to world peace and development.  
In challenging times like this, one's mettle is tested. We are confident that the world will prevail over the #virus and end the crisis.
...been firm in safeguarding our national interests, and spearheaded multilateral cooperation.
We have built a strong defense against the virus at our borders, helped erect an international bulwark against the #coronavirus, made more friends in the world, shared benefits generated by China's opening-up with the world,...
In 2020, we in the foreign service have forged ahead and tackled the challenges head on.
People across the world have increasingly come to see that all countries share a common stake and need to stand together in the face of difficulties. The vision of a community with a shared future for mankind thus enjoys stronger support.
The world is increasingly fluid and changing. The devastating virus, economic recession and governance difficulties are clear challenges facing humanity. #Unilateralism, #protectionism and power politics are standing in the way of international cooperation.
The year 2020 has been extraordinary for #China and the world.
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave an interview to Xinhua News Agency and China Media Group on international situation and China's diplomacy in 2020.  
Happy New Year Ambassador @CWilson_FCDO.

President Xi Jinping is delivering his New Year message.  
A 400-day countdown to the 2022 Beijing Winter #Olympic Games, as Yanqing District has just completed the construction of four major venues very recently.  The Beijing Organizing Committee, as well as athletes, are seizing every moment to achieve excellence.  
The agreement will provide greater market access, better business environment, stronger institutional protection and brighter cooperation prospects for two-way investment. It also represents a key contribution by China & the EU—two vast markets—to building an open world economy.
The China-EU investment agreement demonstrates China's determination and confidence to advance toward a higher level of opening-up.
They jointly announced the conclusion of negotiation on the China-EU investment agreement, meeting the deadline they had set.
President Xi Jinping just had a videoconference with European Council President Michel, European Commission President von der Leyen, German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron.  
Take a close look at the data about China & US responses. They are truth-tellers. They don't lie & speak for all.  
As #WHO DG Tedros said, virus respects no borders, races & ethnicities. China has a clear & transparent timeline on #COVID19 responses, open for all to see. We put people & life front & center.  
.@SecPompeo, isn't lying a feature you've been taking great pride in?!  
British ambassador Wilson @CWilson_FCDO enjoys traveling around China. This time in #Fuzhou, the Southeast coastal city. In Wen Miao, or the #Confucius' Temple, she challenged herself with some old Chinese expressions.  
Charles Onunaiju from #Nigeria: The key implications of the end of poverty in China for the rest of the world is that poverty is not to be accepted as fate but a social scourge that can be eliminated with requisite political will, focused and consistent policy framework.  
#FAST, the largest single dish telescope in southwest China, the only one of its kind, will open to international researchers in 2021.  Scientific cooperation goes beyond borders.

10-year fishing ban in the #YangtzeRiver 2020 climate action targets reached 2 years ahead of schedule Home to the world's 2nd largest carbon trading market and more than half of the electric car market.  
By strengthening strategic cooperation, China and Russia can effectively resist any attempt to suppress and divide the two countries, and meanwhile forge a solid shield to safeguard international fairness and justice.
China-Russia ties will not be affected by changes in the international arena or by any other factors.
The high-level mutual trust and friendship are demonstrated as the two countries stand together to tide over the difficulties and support each other on issues concerning core interests.
2020 has been an extraordinary year. "Real gold can stand the test of fire." The difficult period has given more prominence to the unique strength and great value of China-Russia relationship.
Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke over phone on Monday evening and exchanged good wishes for the New Year.
Special treatment in this special exam season. In Dalian, an asymptomatic patient was arranged to take her postgraduate admission test in a quarantine ward.  #COVID19 should not hold anyone back.
Websites&APPs in China are required to be adapted for use by the elderly & the physically challenged. That means they can read texts with larger font size, reach a telecom help-desk directly, book a ride online with just one touch, etc. Our #DigitalChina leaves no one behind.  
These are President Xi's diplomatic engagements of 2020, which have helped build global consensus on #COVID19 and pointed the way forward for China's foreign policy.
80+ meetings&phone calls with foreign leaders&heads of intl organizations, 22 important diplomatic events, including "cloud diplomacy".  
US economist Jeffrey Sachs: China's #povertyalleviation provides experiences for  many to learn.  
Since Dec. #USMissionCN has posted 60+ false messages about China. Spreading misinformation, inciting confrontation&attacking the Communist Party of China&China's political system, it has betrayed the mission of diplomatic corps to promote understanding, friendship&cooperation.
It starts operation today. The train departs from #Xiongan and arrives in #Beijing with a maximum design speed of 350km/hour through a 91km railway, the 1st direct line connecting Beijing and the "city of the future", where the facilities not related to capital were relocated.  
Data from Ministry of Commerce shows as well the foreign direct investment (#FDI) into the Chinese mainland, in actual use, is surpassing $140 billion this year, another record high. China has remained the world's second largest recipient of FDI since 2017.  
China's total volume of imports and exports is expected to reach 32 trillion yuan (about $4.9 trillion) this year, an increase of 30 percent over the number in 2015, data from the Ministry of Commerce shows.

FAKE NEWS: Over 500k people of ethnic minority groups in #Xinjiang have been coerced into forced labor. FACT CHECK: All ethnic groups in XUAR enjoy the right to choose whatever&wherever they want to work, earning money, learning skills&changing their families w/ their own hands.  
2010-2018 data show: population of ethnic minorities in #Xinjiang increased by 22%; Uyghur population by 25%; Han population by 2%. Numbers will not lie. Has anyone seen any kind of #genocide like this?

Press Conference by Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region on Xinjiang-related Issues in Beijing         
Believe that the people of all ethnic minorities including Uyghur people in #Xinjiang are living a much better life than many ethnic minorities in the #US.
Between 2010 and 2018, the population of ethnic minorities in #Xinjiang increased by 22.14%, much higher than the 2% of ethnic Han population.
Vocational training served as  a turning point for many in #Xinjiang. As one former trainee said, do you need to be forced to make more money, learn more skills & change life with your own hands?
Those made up the lie of "forced labor" are to create "forced unemployment and forced poverty".
In the cotton-picking season, many migrant workers of the ethnic Han group in provinces like Henan, Sichuan & Gansu would go to #Xinjiang for good income. Uyghur people, too, are entitled to pursue a better life through work. Nobody can deprive them of this right.
.@StateDept Lying is shameful & repeating malicious slanders should be strongly condemned. Be brave to the facts.
@StateDept Lying is shameful & repeating malicious slanders should be strongly condemned. Be brave to the facts.
China-Russia relations should be an anchor of stability, even more so amid greater chaos in the world. The #US will only further tarnish its record as it continues imposing unilateral sanctions. China & Russia always uphold international justice.

4. Properly handle regional security issues. #China has proposed to establish a multilateral dialogue platform in the Gulf region to start an inclusive dialogue process to build consensus on regional security issues through equal consultation and incremental progress.
3. Resolve the compliance issues fairly and impartially.
2. Push for an early and unconditional #US return to the #JCPOA. The US should lift sanctions on #Iran and on third-party entities and individuals.
Wang Yi made a 4-point proposal: 1. Make relentless efforts to uphold the #JCPOA and firmly against the maximum pressure.  
The #US withdrawal from the #JCPOA and its maximum pressure on #Iran are the root causes of the Iran nuclear issue deviating from the right direction. The US returning to the deal and resuming compliance is the right way for defusing the tensions.
State Councilor&FM Wang Yi attended a virtual Ministerial Meeting of #JCPOA Participants on Dec. 21.  
The two sides should understand each other correctly and develop relationship following the principles of peaceful coexistence, openness and cooperation, multilateralism and dialogue & consultation.
#China and the #EU, as two important forces for multi-polarization, should jointly provide more stability to the world.  
State Councilor & FM Wang Yi met with envoys to China from the #EU and 27 of its member states in Beijing on Dec. 21. Wang Yi thanked the envoys for their confidence and commitment in Beijing during this eventful year.  
#US debe respetar la soberanía e independencia de #Cuba, cesar el bloqueo, sanciones e injerencia. Nos oponemos firmemente a politizar #DerechosHumanos o usar doble estándar. US debe desarrollar relaciones normales con Cuba basadas en la igualdad y el respeto mutuo. @BrunoRguezP

Unveiling the treasure box: #lunar samples from #ChangE5.

#GreenChina From 2016 to 2020, China has met the goal of 23.04% forest coverage with 11.6bln trees planted and afforesation area totalling 35.26mln ha. 700+ nature reserves were set up. Lucid waters&lush mountains are invaluable assets. Harmonious coexistance between men&nature.  
the giant ship of China-US relations will be able to stay on the right course, maintain a strong momentum, steer clear of hidden shoals and rocks, navigate through the countercurrents and stormy waves, and achieve the goal of mutual benefit and win-win for the world.
and stay committed to principles of mutual respect, equality, seeking common ground while shelving differences, and win-win cooperation,
As long as the two countries act with a sense of responsibility to history and humanity, bear in mind the fundamental interests of the two peoples and the whole world,
It is important that people with vision in both countries jointly oppose stigmatizing people-to-people exchange and politicizing normal contact, and remove stumbling blocks to such contact and exchange.
#China has no intention to pick a fight with the #US either in #diplomacy, media or other fields.
To view all Chinese students, experts and scholars in the #US as spy suspects actually says more about the mentality of the accusers and their lack of confidence.
People with vision in both countries should jointly reject the attempts to disrupt people-to-people contact and create a cultural decoupling between the two countries, and work together to encourage and support people from all sectors to increase exchanges & mutual understanding.
On people-to-people exchange, we need to remove restrictions as soon as possible.
#China will work with countries in the region to maintain the freedom of navigation and overflight under international law.
There has been no problem with the freedom of navigation and overflight in the #SouthChinaSea. There has never been a single instance where normal navigation or overflight was impeded.
On maritime issues, we need to strive to turn frictions into cooperation.
We urge the #US side to stop overstretching the notion of #NationalSecurity, stop the arbitrary suppression of Chinese companies, and provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese businesses and investors.
The Chinese market is expected to become the largest and most vibrant in the world. This means #China can and need to buy more products with active demand in the Chinese market from the #US, and it is just a matter of time before the trade imbalance is eased.
There are no winners in trade wars, which only hurt both sides. What has happened proves that pressuring others with tariffs would only boomerang.
On trade issues, we need to replace confrontation and sanctions with dialogue and consultation. What drives trade is market demand, not imposed deals.  
For our foreign friends who truly care about #China and wish to know more about #Xinjiang, #Tibet and other parts of China, we are always ready to share with them the facts.
This seriously violates international law and defies international justice and conscience. As an independent sovereign state, #China naturally has to respond.
There has been too much false information about #Xinjiang and #Tibet, and the executive branch and #Congress have, on this basis, exercised long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese businesses and individuals.
Issues relating to #Taiwan, #HongKong, #Tibet and #Xinjiang are China's internal affairs and involve China's core interests. None of them shall be subject to foreign interference.
On issues concerning national sovereignty and territorial integrity, we need to commit to the international norm of non-interference in other's internal affairs.
If the #US China policy were to remodel or even subvert China, it would not be achievable. The right approach is to respect each other's political system and development path, maintain peaceful coexistence, and promote win-win cooperation.
Both Chinese and American systems are chosen by their people and deeply rooted in their respective historical and cultural traditions.  
The goal of China-US engagement is not to mold the other in one’s own image, still less to defeat the other side, but to seek and expand common interests.
On ideological issues, we need to respect each other's choice of system and development path.
China's stance is that the two sides should manage constructively the prominent and important issues based on a right perception of each other.
We hope the #US side will join us in rebuilding the strategic framework for the healthy and steady growth of China-US relations on the basis of mutual respect, through dialogue and consultation, and by way of deepening our common interests and enhancing the support by the people.
The time has come to decide the future course of this giant vessel.
The giant vessel of China-US relationship carries not only the well-being of the 1.7 billion Chinese and Americans, but also the interests of the over seven billion people of the world.
While China-US cooperation can make great things happen for the two countries and the entire world, China-US confrontation would definitely spell disaster for not only the two countries but also humanity as a whole.
Neither can do without the other, remodel the other, or replace the other. The bilateral relationship is no zero-sum game; the success of one does not have to entail the other's failure.
China's policy toward the #US is always stable and consistent.
It is important that the #US policy toward #China return to objectivity and sensibility as early as possible.
Facts have proved, and will continue to prove, that these attempts will lead nowhere and find no support.
Fourth, they attempt to build an international coalition against #China. But in the age of #globalization, the interests of all countries are so intertwined that the overwhelming majority of them do not want to take sides, let alone being forced into confrontation with China.
Third, they hope that maximum pressure will make #China give in. Power politics will only get the Chinese people to be more resolved in their response.
An attack on the #CPC is an attack on the 1.4 billion Chinese people. It is doomed to fail.
Second, they seek to defame the Communist Party of China out of ideological bias. The #CPC, as the constitutionally recognized ruling party of #China, has a close bond and a shared future with the Chinese people.
First, they choose to ignore the vast common interests and room for cooperation between the two countries, and insist that #China is a main threat.
The fundamental reason behind all this is that some #US politicians have strategic miscalculations about #China.
Regrettably however, when we turn on TVs, read newspapers, and access new media, we would often see senior #US officials pointing fingers at #China. There is no evidence to support their accusations. They are merely irresponsible presumption of guilt and emotional lashing out.
#China stays committed to developing a relationship based on coordination, cooperation and stability with the #UnitedStates under the principle of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. China has been working in good faith to that goal.
#China has no intention to compete for #hegemony. We never interfere in other's internal affairs. We don't export our system and model. Not in the least do we seek spheres of influence.
We need to step up to our responsibilities as major countries and at the same time, work together with other countries to overcome difficulties, meet challenges and pursue development.
What is expected of #China and the #US is to form the right perception about one another, act in line with the trend of the times, and heed the aspirations of the international community.
We see power politics jeopardizing international stability, protectionism jeopardizing international trade, #unilateralism jeopardizing international cooperation and #McCarthyism jeopardizing international exchanges.
In retrospect, 2020 might have witnessed the greatest damage to the international order and international relations.
China-US relations has spiraled down to the lowest level since the establishment of diplomatic ties 41 years ago. This is clearly not in the interests of the Chinese and American peoples, nor is it helpful when global efforts are needed to overcome the difficulties.
In 2020, #COVID19 has upended the world in almost all aspects. Countries have come to realize more than ever that global challenge requires enhanced international coordination and cooperation, and that major countries in particular should lead by example.
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is delivering an address at the Special Event hosted by Asia Society.  
British Ambassador Wilson @CWilson_FCDO apparently enjoyed her trip to #Wuhan. Hope to see more cooperation between #Hubei and the #UK.  
 
Thank you Ambassador.
150+ seconds on the journey of #ChangE5.  
Mission accomplished! Back home! The return capsule of #ChangE5 probe has landed on Earth. Many stayed up the whole night waiting for this moment.  A space travel of over 760000km in 23 days, #ChangE5  brought back China's first samples collected from the moon.  
They not only raised the visibility of their countries in China, but also showed their love and contributed to poverty reduction.
We thank the envoys from the embassy of the #UAE, #SouthAfrica, #Ethiopia, #Italy and #Ireland for their presence and all the diplomatic corps for their participation.

"Snow Ruyi" will host ski jumping events during the #Beijing2022 Winter Olympics.  
Live: Love Knows No Borders- International Charity Sale  
Ready for #ChangE5's homecoming. With added difficulty as the return capsule of #ChangE5's probe is only 1/7 the size of the return capsule of China's manned spaceship, while the landing area is 16x larger, the search & retrieval team is well-prepared.  
Hoh Xil National Nature Reserve in Qinghai Province, northwest China, is now widely known as baby Tibetan antelopes' kindergarten as the lost baby antelopes are rescued there. Human nannies bottle-feed and take very good care of the babies.  
From #ADB newly published report: Asian Development Outlook (#ADO) 2020 Supplement.  
Skilled labor brings more income. It happens in #Tibet:  ▶Over 10 public vocational institutions, at least one in each prefectural area ▶386mln yuan earmarked for 724 training projects since 2016  ▶112,900 residents benefited  
As Ambassador Djauhari Oratmangun said, China-Indonesia relations feature cooperation, collaboration and bright future. This is true of #COVID19 response, #BeltandRoad cooperation and much more over the past 70 years of diplomatic relations.  
We will take solid steps to implement the targets just announced, and contribute even more to tackling the global climate challenge.
China always honors its commitments. Guided by our new development philosophy, we will promote greener economic and social development in all respects while pursuing high-quality development.
China will increase the forest stock volume by 6 billion cubic meters from the 2005 level, and bring its total installed capacity of wind and solar power to over 1.2 billion kilowatts.
China will lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of #GDP by over 65% from the 2005 level, and increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25%.
President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the the #climateambitionsummit2020 through video link on Dec 12 and announced further commitments for China's nationally determined contributions.
What we have achieved is definitely not the end of our journey, but a new beginning of our endeavor.  
For 8 years, China has in total lifted nearly 100 million poverty-stricken people out of poverty. This is a miracle for the development and progress of humanity. This also means we have put an end to extreme poverty that has existed in China for the past several thousand years.
Our international charity sale is a part of China’s national endeavor to eliminate extreme poverty.
The things we are doing may not seem to be that grand, but they are very specific and much needed by the people in need. Our efforts have changed the future of these children and brought laughter back to their families.  
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the 12th Love Knows No Borders International Charity Sale. #COVID19 may have affected our face to face communication, but it cannot stop us from passing on love.  
British Ambassador Caroline Wilson @CWilson_FCDO had a close contact with terracotta warriors in Xi'an, China.
Children tell their stories with "Love Knows No Borders".   
Love knows no borders. International charity sale kicks off today.   
日本の皆さん、本来は今月末までに中国に返還される予定だったパンダのシャンシャンですが、来年5月31日まで日本滞在が延長されることになりました！上野動物園の皆さん、もうしばらくシャンシャンのこと、よろしくお願いします！  
Xiang Xiang will stay in Japan until May 31, 2021. This is really good news for the panda-loving Japanese people. We hope Xiang Xiang will enjoy her stay & Ueno Zoo will continue to take good care of her.  
As the last member left office, the paralysis of the Appellate Body has plunged WTO's "crown jewel", the dispute settlement mechanism, into darkness, but efforts to safeguard the multilateral trading system should not stop.
The right to subsistence & development is a fundamental human right. If a government doesn't even care about its own people's life, how can it truly care about & protect human rights in other countries?!
State Councilor and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi addressed at the Symposium on the International Situation and China's Foreign Relations in 2020:  
The International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage granted world heritage status to four irrigation projects in South, Southeast and Northwest China. This brought the total number of World Heritage Irrigation Site in China to 23.  
One of the biggest lies of this century.  
日本の皆さん！そして上野公園の皆さん！パンダのシャンシャンに愛をもって接していただき心から感謝します。子供たちをはじめとする日本の皆さんに沢山の喜びと楽しさをもたらしたシャンシャンは、私たちの誇るべき親善大使です。
We understand it must be hard for the Japanese people to say goodbye to XiangXiang. We thank them, in particular the Ueno Zoo, for taking such good care of her. Cute cuddly pandas have brought so much joy to the Japanese people, especially kids. They are our goodwill ambassadors.  
China is also revoking visa exemption treatment for US diplomatic passport holders paying temporary visits to Hong Kong & Macao. China once again urges the US to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs & not to go down the dangerous wrong path.
...the executive branch, people of #Congress & NGOs who act egregiously & bear major responsibilities on Hong Kong-related issues as well as their immediate family members.
As the #US uses Hong Kong-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs & harm China's core interests, China decides to impose reciprocal sanctions on US officials of…
How can anyone expect China to be a silent lamb while others try to devour it with trumped-up charges? The so-called "wolf warrior diplomacy" is nothing but a tailor-made trap to deprive China of its right to speak the truth.
Isn't China entitled to the right to present facts while others keep slandering & maligning it? Isn't China entitled to the right to defend sovereignty, security, development interests, national honor & dignity just as any citizen can exercise the right to self-defense?
For those accusing China of "wolf warrior diplomacy", I wonder what they think of #Simba in #TheLionKing? Of all recent incidents, was any single one provoked by China?
Bullies seeking supremacy will end up friendless. China & Russia stand for #multilateralism, #equity & #justice. @mfa_russia
FM #Lavrov speaks for many countries when he said China & Russia would not succumb to a unipolar world order. No country has the right to control others' destiny or monopolize development.
We will continue to implement outcomes of #FOCAC Beijing Summit & Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity against #COVID19 to deliver more benefits for Chinese & African people.
Congrats on the 60th anniversary of African-Chinese People's Friendship Association. ACPFA bears witness to how the Chinese & African people always stand together through weal & woe.
Wufushan high-speed rail station in Jiangxi, the tiniest one in China, breathes new life in town. The traveling time to any places drops considerably, and the local National Forest Park and other tourist spots become accessible.  
Many Chinese children dream to become scientists when they grow up. No matter whether the dreams come true, #science is embraced throughout their life, especially in the face of #pandemics. This is just as good.  
"Very good neighbors and very good friends." China and #Nepal celebrate the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties this year. The recent joint announcement of new height of Mt. #Qomolangma reflects the high level of continuous development of the relations.
 
What can 1 yuan ($0.15) do? In China, it could be the cost of a train ticket, unchanged for decades. Public service trains, or slow trains, link up sparsely-populated areas hard to get to or out of. They take children to school, farmers to markets and patients to hospitals.  
The #US remains the world's top arms exporter, with 12 American companies taking up 61% of all sales of the top 25 arms traders. #Taiwan authorities contributed significantly to the revenues of US arms dealers.
He's neither the first nor likely the last to have such an experience. We hope all could be free of coercion & being wronged.
According to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the intelligence on former #EU diplomat Sabathil "being a Chinese spy" was fed by #US intelligence agencies to #German security departments.
With over 1.4bln population, 400mln-strong mid-income group, the Chinese market is a market for the world, a market shared by all & a market accessible to all.
China's foreign trade of goods registered positive growth for the third consecutive month by November, up by 1.8 percent year-on-year.
No country can become an independent innovation center or enjoy fruits of #innovation alone; innovation should benefit the world rather than being encaved. China stands ready to enhance scientific innovation cooperation with other countries.
In 2019, China's IP office received 1.4mln patent applications, more than twice the amount received by authorities in the second-busiest country, the US. China filed 110,000 applications of #AI patents, the highest number in the world.
#Pompeo is right in saying "this isn't about America vs. China". This is indeed about a few Americans' hypocritical values of human rights, democracy vs. mankind's shared values & US unilateral bullying, hegemony vs. multilateralism, international justice.
The #US is committed to helping Tibetans safeguard their way of life? They'd better be committed to protecting American people's lives now.
Sec. #Pompeo announced sanctions on vice chairpersons of China's NPCSC. This is serious violation of basic norms of international relations&interference in China's internal affairs. China will take firm&strong countermeasures to defend sovereignty, security&development interests.
Ahmatjan, a young architect with a big dream, takes pride in designing and shaping the future of his hometown in #Xinjiang. Indeed, if the youth are strong, society will be strong.

Just now Pres. Xi Jinping & Pres. Bidya Devi Bhandari jointly announced the new height of Mt. Qomolangma: 8848.86m. China & Nepal will continue cooperation on ecological conservation & scientific research for Mt. Qomolangma, our shared treasure & home.
It is the #US, not China, that "stands in a league of its own" in its abuses of the environment.  
Wanton criticism of China on this issue only exposes the double standards.
It is common practice worldwide for civil servants to take an oath of allegiance. 170+ countries have this enshrined in the constitution. Over 20 US lawmakers and 50 British MPs have been disqualified for violating parliamentary rules, etc.
We oppose & condemn malign attacks by Sec. #POMPEO against China's political system & further restrictions on people-to-people exchange. Inciting ideological confrontation will only further sabotage China-US relations & is not in the two peoples' interests.
China launched #Gaofen14, an optical satellite, on board the Long March 3B carrier rocket on Dec 6.  
 
Zezo, an Egyptian influencer, has kept recording people's life in different Chinese villages. Recently he spent a day in Hunan as an assistant to village doctor Zeng Fengling, showing how she is on call for home visits 24hrs a day & follows each patient signed up for the service.  
The power transmission & transformation project at over 4,300 meters above sea level became fully operational in #Tibet. More stable and reliable electric power supply is now accessible.

To promote Africa's prosperity and development, China has worked with Africa to formulate and implement the ten cooperation plans and the eight major initiatives.
To uphold Africa's peace and security, China is following through on its pledged free military assistance worth US$ 100 million to the AU and has extended military aid to the Joint Force of the G5 for the Sahel via bilateral and multilateral channels.

Delivery is on the way. #ChangE5 carrying the lunar samples is expected to carry out unmanned rendezvous and docking with the orbiter-returner in lunar orbit, an unprecedented feat.  
Wintersweet blossoms in suburb #Beijing brighten this morning in the winter.  
Fantastic! Don't quite understand but really proud!
The life expectancy of Chinese people increased from 35 years in 1949 to 77.3 years in 2019.  Better health care and basic health insurance have played a big part.  
In the Three-River-Source National Park in #Qinghai, China, home to the three major rivers and many wildlife, more and more people join the volunteer team to collect rubbish and protect the environment.  In green vests, they add green coverage to the site.  
In #Guizhou, the traditional Batik craft attracts tourists and helps relocated ethnic Miao people shake off poverty. This year, one Batik workshop welcomed over 6000 tourists and generated a monthly income of 2000 yuan for the 13 workers.  
China has accomplished its #PovertyAlleviation target of the new era as scheduled.  
 
On the way home! #ChangE5 blasted off from the #moon with the lunar samples.   Have a safe journey home!  
Its true purpose is to create excuses to justify  high-tech blockage against #China, and this will eventually damage the interests of China, the #US and the whole world.
The #US practice of integrated military and civilian development dates back to before #WWI. The US groundless accusations against China are typical double standards.
China will deeply engage in global #IPgovernance and make the global IP governance system more just and equitable.
Over the past 5 years, China moved upward to the 14th place in the #innovation ranking of 131 economies. Innovation has become the primary driving force of national development.
China has achieved historic progress in protecting #IPR. In the first 10 months of this year, the number of invention patent applications in China reached 1.232m. 55,000 applications filed via the PCT were accepted.
Coffee handed with a toy-bear paw and a rose/handshake/pat on the head. The lovely cafe is owned by and hopes to support people with disabilities. And that makes it more popular. Feel so warm on this #IDPD amid #COVID19.  
The bulk of the projects come from 3 major industries such as big data, health, logistics, and 3 new industries, namely, new energy, new manufacturing, and new materials.
Fruitful results coming from China-ASEAN Expo (#CAEXPO)! 86 investment cooperation projects were signed, with the total investment volume of $40.1 billion, a 43.6% year-on-year increase.  
Ready to work together with #WIPO, China will help to push the global intellectual property governance system in a  more just and equitable direction!
China on the move to strengthen intellectual property rights (#IPR) protection. While presiding over a group study session of the Political Bureau of the #CPC Central Committee, President Xi Jinping stressed that protecting IPR is equal to protecting innovation.
Sampling completed! After about 19 hours of work on the #moon's surface, #ChangE5 successfully completed robotic sample collection, and the samples were sealed and packaged.  
If winter comes, can spring be far behind? As long as we join hands, act in solidarity and coordination, we will achieve the final victory.
China will continue cooperating with other countries including the #US on epidemic prevention and control, and providing as much support and assistance as possible.
The world is safe only when each and every country is safe. The final victory is achieved only when #COVID19 is defeated in the last country.
Many Chinese localities, businesses and groups also donated medical supplies to the #US. Chinese and American pharmaceutical manufacturers and scientists also keep in communication and cooperation on vaccine and medical R & D.
China has provided to the #US 39.43bln masks, 800mln pairs of surgical gloves, 650mln protective suits, and 46.762mln pairs of goggles. Dr. Zhong Nanshan and other top experts have shared experience with US clinical doctors via video conferences.

On November 30, the Lancang-Mekong water resource cooperation information sharing platform was officially launched online. It will contribute to rational utilization and sustainable development of Lancang-Mekong water resources.
Shopping generates happiness to both consumers and sellers, especially those in poverty-stricken areas. We diplomats contribute our share regularly as well.
The first to see the dawn and the last to wave goodbye to the dusk. Construction workers are the builders of modern skyscrapers and the creators of cozy homes for millions.  Salute!  
Coffee please. For me and many others, a cup a day keeps drowsiness away. Glad to share this amazing video of Premium beans production in Yunnan. Traveling across the world, the small beans increase locals' income and connect China with the rest of the world.
The China-Japan "fast track" for the movement of people was officially launched on Nov 30 as scheduled. It  serves as a highway for the resumption of business and production amid the battle against #COVID19.  
I wonder how Taiwan compatriots think about it when they know their wealth gained through hard work is spent on buying second-hand US weapons and used as an ATM for interest groups in the US?
#Taiwan has spent $11.8 billion in purchasing #US weapons this year, equaling NT$14,500 of per capita spending.
We urge relevant countries to immediately lift illegal and inhuman #UCMs.
Unilateral coercive measures (#UCMs) contradict the purposes and principles of the #UNCharter and international law and seriously trample upon the basic #HumanRights of the people of the affected countries, especially the vulnerable groups. They are unbearable burdens to them.
The #Australian government reacted so strongly. Do they think the merciless killing of #Afghan civilians is justified while the condemnation of such ruthless brutality is not? Afghan lives also matter!
The details in this report are shocking and hair-raising, and the atrocities have been unequivocally and strongly condemned and deplored by the international community.
The appalling crimes committed by some #Australian soldiers in #Afghanistan have been reported by the Australian media and confirmed by the Australian Department of Defense in an inquiry report.
This fully shows the growing "magnetic field" effect of the Expo platform, where more and more Chinese and overseas companies share development dividends.
85.3% was attributed to the 3 major industries and 3 new industries, namely, big data, health, logistics, new energy, new manufacturing, and new materials.

با توجه به اوضاع بسیار پیچیده و حساس منطقه اى، همه طرف ها باید جهت كاهش تنش  و حفظ صلح و ثبات در منطقه مشتركا تلاش كنند. #Mohsen_Fakhrizadeh @JZarif @IRIMFA
شوكه شده از قتل آقاى محسن فخری زاده، دانشمند ايرانى. ما اين جنايت خشونت آميز را محکوم میکنیم و خواستار بررسى و بازرسى جدی آن هستيم. چین با هر گونه اقدامى كه منجر به افزایش تنش و تخريب صلح و ثبات در منطقه ميشود  مخالف است. #محسن_فخری_زاده
Given the highly complex and sensitive situation in the region, all parties should work together to ease regional tensions and maintain regional peace and stability.
Shocked by the killing of Iranian scientist #Mohsen_Fakhrizadeh. We condemn this violent crime and call for thorough investigation. China opposes any act that aggravates regional tensions and undermines regional peace and stability. @JZarif @IRIMFA_EN @IRIMFA_AR
 
Schools, nursing homes for the elderly and office buildings, even these civil institutions identified by Google map were called concentration camps by the #ASPI. Isn't the real purpose of the "think tank" fully exposed? How can it still be an "academic institution"?  
According to the #SouthChinaSea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative, the #US military sent 3 reconnaissance aircraft to the South China Sea on a surveillance mission on Nov. 28. One of them used a fake transponder code.  
Here's the fact.

The channel of Sichuan TV has a new "anchor". Tamdrin #DingZhen, who broadcasts news in his native language Tibetan as a guest.  
#ChangE5 made a successful "brake" after 112 hours' travel in the space and entered the lunar orbit. It is a vital step for landing on the moon.  
The more others seek seclusion and decoupling, the more open and inclusive we will be. One's mindset determines one's prospect.  What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.  
#Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei encouraged its departing Honor sub-brand to become Huawei's strongest global competitor.  
The success stories of Striver and #Shenzhou10 remind me of Late Chairman Mao Zedong's poem. The human being will be able to clasp the moon in the universe and seize turtles deep down in the Oceans.  The dreams are coming true.  
China's new deep-sea manned submersible #Fendouzhe (Striver) returned home safe and sound after its mission completed.  It set a new record of reaching 10909m deep.
Zhou Chengyu, the 24-year-ond lady of Tujia ethnic group, took the mission as the commander of the rocket connector system in Chang'e-5 launching.  
The county is a birthplace of traditional Chinese medicine, culture of seclusion in East Asia and "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains", a landscape painting completed in 1350.

Despite the spread of #COVID19, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi paid a visit to #ROK, which shows the remarkable resilience and vitality of China-ROK relations.  
China will train for #ASEAN countries 1,000 administrative and specialized personnel in the health sector, and work with ASEAN in developing the Regional Reserve of Medical Supplies for Public Health Emergencies and launching a Liaison Mechanism for Public Health Emergencies.
When its #COVID19 #vaccines are available for use, #China will actively consider the needs of #ASEAN countries.
We need to strengthen cooperation against #COVID19 and enhance capacity building in public health.
We also need to strengthen the protection of #DataSecurity and policy communication and coordination, and build a digital #SilkRoad.
We need to deepen cooperation on the #DigitalEconomy. We could create more highlights of cooperation in smart city, #5G, artificial intelligence, e-commerce, big data, blockchain and telemedicine.
We need to further implement our free trade agreement. China will work with #ASEAN countries to sustain the smooth flow of #trade, promote mutual #investment, open up markets wider to each other, and foster deeply integrated industrial, supply and value chains.
We need to further synergize our development plans. We need speed up the development of existing economic corridors and key projects, and continue to develop the #China-#ASEAN Multimodal Transport Alliance.
Never before have the destinies of people in different countries been so closely connected. We will cultivate a closer #China-#ASEAN #community with a shared future.
The #China-#ASEAN relationship has grown into the most successful and vibrant model for cooperation in the Asia-Pacific and an exemplary effort in building a #community with a shared future for mankind.
President Xi Jinping delivered remarks at the the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit on Nov 27.  
#5G knows no borders. Communication and mutual learning develop the technology further. Lives and the world will be transformed for the better.  By all, and more importantly, for all.
A sad day for #football and millions of fans.  Those exciting memories #Maradona brought to us will not fade away.  Thanks and Farewell, legend!

Vice President Wang Qishan also congratulated Mme #Harris on her election as the US Vice President.
President Xi  just congratulated #Biden on his election as the #US President. To promote sound and steady development of China-U.S. relations serves the fundamental interests of the Chinese and American peoples. It also meets the expectation of the wider international community.
Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, the big years for sports with #Tokyo Olympics and #Beijing Winter Games definitely the highlights. State Councillor & FM Wang Yi expressed during his visit to Japan that China will cooperate with Japan to present the best events to the world.  
Welcome to the world #XiaoQiJi! This #panda baby, as his name indicates, is truly a little miracle for this special year!
Down to ZERO! Today ALL 832 poverty-stricken counties in China have been lifted out of poverty. This is not the end, but a new start to common rich and prosperity. Together we can achieve!

元気なパンダの赤ちゃんが誕生したニュースを嬉しく聞きました。パパの「永明（えいめい）」（28歳）とママの「良浜（らうひん）」（20歳）におめでとうございます。「多子多福」（子沢山の家庭は福沢山）。新たな中日友好の「小大使」、健やかに育つように。
Another cute baby panda! #Japan's Wakayama has just welcomed the 10th cub of giant panda Rauhin and Eimei. The lucky place has really become the "second hometown" for pandas! Hope the new life can light up the haze of #COVID19, and bring more good news to China-Japan friendship!  
Over 1.32 bln Chinese people (or 94.9% of the total) have social security cards, including 300mil+ e-cards. The e-version enables people to access more services with just a touch on the screen. Digital technology makes lives better.  
7th World Internet Conference is now on in Wuzhen, Zhejiang. Actually the Province has become the most "digital" one in China, as the technology is integrated with daily lives and contributes over 60% to industrial growth in the first 3 quarters this year.
We are keen to work with other countries to make our world a better place, a place free from #poverty and blessed by common #development.
Over the past four decades and more since the reform and opening-up, #China has lifted more than 700 million people out of #poverty, contributing more than 70% to global poverty reduction.
Overcoming the impact of #COVID19, #China is about to attain its goal of eradicating extreme #poverty 10 years ahead of schedule.
We need to leverage the role of #digital economy in #PovertyReduction, make it more inclusive, and provide more opportunities for #SMEs, #women, #youth and other #vulnerable groups to move from #poverty to #prosperity.
We should reduce the #debt burden on developing countries. At the same time, we need to continue to provide necessary #financial support for developing countries and build homegrown #capacity to reduce #poverty.
Guided by the #UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we need to strengthen development cooperation, narrow the North-South gap and strive for common #development and #prosperity.
#Development is the master key to ending #poverty. The development agenda ought to feature more prominently in global macro policy coordination.

China will scale up its nationally determined contributions and strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve #CarbonNeutrality by 2060. China will honor its commitment and see the implementation through.
The #Earth is our shared home. We may follow the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind and pitch in to tackle climate and other environmental challenges and protect the blue planet.
President Xi Jinping just delivered remarks at the leaders' side event on Safeguarding the Planet of the #G20 Riyadh Summit through video link.
Let us join hands to deliver a better life for our people and build a #community with a shared future for mankind.
"Past a fallen ship, one thousand sail onward; for a sick tree, ten thousand thrive by spring." When #COVID19 is over, our world will rise from the #pandemic  and emerge even stronger.
While making the Chinese economy more resilient and competitive, it also aims to build a new system of open economy of higher standards. This will create more opportunities for the world to benefit from China's high-quality development.
China’s new development paradigm is by no means a closed-door policy. Instead, it urges efforts on both the supply and demand sides to ensure unimpeded flow in production, distribution, exchange and consumption.
We need to enhance the role of the #WHO, improve #pandemic preparedness and response, forge a strong shield for human health and safety, and build a global community of health for all.
The most pressing task of the moment is to shore up the global public health system and contain #COVID19 and other infectious diseases.
Recently, China launched the Global Initiative on #DataSecurity. We may work on that basis and join other parties for discussing and formulating rules on global digital governance.
We should support the #UN's leadership role in this field, and work together to foster an open, fair, just and nondiscriminatory environment for building the digital economy.
To address countries' concerns on #datasecurity, the digital divide, personal privacy and ethics, we should adopt people-centered and facts-based policies to encourage innovation and build trust.
We should promote free trade, oppose #unilateralism and #protectionism, and protect the development rights, interests and space of developing countries.
We should firmly safeguard the rules-based multilateral trading system and support the reform of the #WTO to enhance its effectiveness and authority.
We should uphold #multilateralism, pursue openness and #inclusiveness, promote mutually beneficial cooperation and keep pace with the times. The #G20 ought to play a bigger role in this process.
The grave challenge of #COVID19 has exposed the deficiencies of global governance. The principle of extensive #consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits should guide our way forward.
China proposes the holding of an international conference on food loss and waste in due course, and welcomes the active participation of #G20 members and relevant international organizations.
We need to enhance #datasecurity cooperation, strengthen the digital infrastructure, and level the playing field for high-tech companies from all countries.
We ought to adapt to change and turn #crisis into #opportunity. We may deepen structural reform and cultivate new growth drivers through scientific and technological #innovation and digital #transformation.
China has proposed a global mechanism on the mutual recognition of health certificates based on nucleic acid test results in the form of internationally accepted QR codes. We hope more countries will join this mechanism.
We need to further harmonize policies and standards and establish "fast tracks" to facilitate the orderly flow of personnel.
We will honor our #commitment of giving assistance and support to other developing countries, and work to make #vaccines a global public good accessible and affordable to people around the world.
China actively supports and participates in international #cooperation on #COVID19 vaccines. We have joined the #COVAX facility and stand ready to step up cooperation with other countries on the R&D, production and distribution of #vaccines.
President Xi Jinping just delivered remarks at Session I of the 15th #G20  Leaders' Summit through video link.  
China stands ready to share our experiences esp. in digital transformation with the rest of the world.
Congratulations to #Shanghai for winning the #SmartestCity award by SCEWC! The first Chinese city to win this award.  At present, Shanghai has 31,400 #5G outdoor base stations and 49,800 5G indoor small stations.  
First snow in this winter, #Beijing.  
Strengthening Solidarity and Cooperation to Build a Better Future Together — Remarks by State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi At the Global Town Hall on "Rebuilding from the COVID-19 World". Full text:  
State Councilor&FM Wang Yi wrote a letter of gratitude to British Ambassador Wilson, for Consul General Ellison in Chongqing saving a young lady from drowning. He hopes that both sides will join the efforts to further promote China-UK relations and strengthen people's friendship.
China is ready to work with all other parties in the Asia-Pacific to build and share a brighter future of peace and #prosperity for our region and get ever closer to the goal of a #community with a shared future for mankind.
China highly values the role of #APEC. We will continue to support the organization's development, and with our root struck deep in the Asia-Pacific, we will continue to serve its #development and #prosperity.
We hope these efforts will contribute to anti-epidemic #cooperation and economic #recovery.
We support #APEC in strengthening policy exchanges and capacity building in the areas of public health and MSMEs. China has made a telemedicine initiative to give people in poor and remote areas access to timely and quality medical services.
We must step up research and development of #vaccines and related exchanges, and work harder to make the vaccines a global public good to improve their #accessibility  and affordability in developing countries.
Our economic #cooperation has never been a zero-sum political game in which one gains at the expense of the other. Rather, our #cooperation has provided us with a #development platform to ensure what we each do can be mutually reinforcing and beneficial to all.
Next year, China will host a workshop on digital technology-enabled #poverty alleviation, in a bid to unleash the role of #digital technologies in eradicating poverty in our region.
China calls for experience sharing among #APEC members on how to control #COVID19 &achieve economic recovery with digital technologies. China also calls for improving the doing-digital-business environment, energizing market players, &tapping the potential of the digital economy.
The #APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap should be implemented in full to spur the dissemination and application of new technologies, strengthen digital infrastructure, and close the #DigitalDivide.
The #digital economy represents the future direction of global #development, while #innovation has fueled the economic takeoff of the Asia-Pacific.
China welcomes the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (#RCEP), and will favorably consider joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (#CPTPP).
We must stay as determined as ever to support the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core, promote free and open trade and investment, and make economic #globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.
Free and open trade and investment cannot be achieved overnight. It is important that the Asia-Pacific should remain the bellwether in safeguarding #peace and #stability, upholding #multilateralism, and fostering an open world economy.
Together, we can build an Asia-Pacific #community with a shared future featuring #openness and #inclusiveness, innovation-driven growth, greater connectivity, and mutually beneficial #cooperation.
One priority on this year's #APEC agenda is to unveil the post-2020 vision, a pathway toward our goal of building an Asia-Pacific #community. This should be taken as a new starting point for us to begin another phase in Asia-Pacific #cooperation.
Both the world and the Asia-Pacific are experiencing profound changes. Where should Asia-Pacific #cooperation be heading? The answer bears on the development of our region, the well-being of our people, and the future of the world at large.
The world #economy is like the Pacific Ocean around us—It admits water from various rivers, and connects different parts of the world. As such, it has acquired a vast magnitude and enormous vitality.
President Xi Jinping delivered remarks at the 27th #APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting through video link.  
 
Ignored complains from locals & human rights groups. 'Possibility' of more killings than what's been revealed.
Barbarian. Unarmed Afghan civilians & detainees allegedly murdered. Young soldiers forced to kill defenseless captives.  "Organisational blindness" to the actions. Secrecy and cover-up. Whistleblower treated like "traitor".
Chasing dreams and moving forward: footprints and memories of the #BRI.   
 
 
 
"Strengthening Solidarity and Cooperation to Build a Better Future Together"—State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered his remarks at the Global Town Hall on "Rebuilding from the #COVID19 World" though video link.  
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave an written interview with Asharq Al-Awast, which covers a wide range of topics: #G20's significance, anti-virus cooperation, global governance and etc.  
Ambassador Wilson updates her stay in China. This time a trip to #Shanghai.
Heartfelt cheers! For each and every progress the young generation made. They are the country's future. In addition to passing the torch, we will also give them our support and encouragement.
#Ambassadors to China know first-hand about China. They were with us when fighting #COVID19 and witnessed our socio-economic development. While striving to be better, we are ready to share our experiences with the whole world.
The day will come when we finally beat #COVID19 and win #victory in this fight.
Step by step, we can surely turn our #vision into #reality and deliver a better life for people in the region.
We are a community with a common stake, and we need to move toward closer regional economic #integration. We need to accelerate innovation-driven growth, enhance regional #connectivity, and realize inclusive and sustainable development.
The development of the #AsiaPacific and greater economic cooperation in our region represent an underlying historical trend, and such development&cooperation will continue to be imbued with strong vitality, because they respond to the call of the people in our region.
The #AsiaPacific is our shared home. To sustain peace, stability, development and prosperity in the region meets the interests of us all. As Asia-Pacific economies are connected by the same ocean, we benefit from close interactions between our peoples and geographic proximity.
China will continue to deepen international #cooperation for shared benefits. We welcome cooperation with every other region, country, or company that wants to do so.
The lawful rights and interests of foreign investors will be protected. China will open up the service sector in a well-planned way, and foster a market-oriented, world-class business environment underpinned by a sound legal framework.
China will advance trade&investment liberalization and facilitation, to conclude, through negotiation, high-standard free trade agreements with more countries, and to actively engage in bilateral, multilateral and regional mechanisms for trade&investment cooperation.
I wish to reiterate that China's #commitment to #openingup is strong, and that China will open its door still wider to the world.
Yet China has not stalled in its pursuit of #openingup. As a matter of fact, we have taken many policy steps to open the country still wider.
China is committed to #openingup, which is its fundamental policy, a policy that will not change at any time. The world economy has faced more instability and uncertainty this year. #Protectionism and #unilateralism are mounting.
The 3rd China International Import Expo (#CIIE) was participated by companies from 124 countries and regions. Deals worth US$72.62 billion were sealed.
The China International Fair for Trade in Services (#CIFTIS) held this September brought together 22,000 companies from 148 countries and regions to its online and off line events.
China's per capita #GDP has topped US$10,000, and its middle-income population has exceeded 400 million. It is projected by international institutions that China's retail market will reach 6 trillion dollars in size this year.
China will fully unlock its market potential and create greater demand for other countries.
China is already deeply #integrated into the global economy and the international system. We will not reverse course or run against historical trend by "#decoupling" or forming a small circle to keep others out.
#Openness enables a country to move forward, while seclusion holds it back. As economic #globalization has become an irreversible trend, no country can develop itself by keeping its doors closed.
We will take more steps and remove with greater resolve deep-seated systemic and institutional barriers to #modernize China's #governance system and capacity.
What we have achieved during the past 40-plus years of China’s #reform and #openingup shows one thing: Reform is crucial for unleashing and boosting #productivity.
We will endeavor to build an #innovation system that integrates science and technology, education, industries and the financial sector, and upgrade the industrial chains.
We will fully leverage the demand of our super-sized domestic market and the strengths of its complete industrial system.
To China, #innovation has always been the primary driver of #development.
#China will continue to deepen supply-side structural reforms and further expand #domesticdemand. This will usher in a higher stage of well-adjusted #balance where demand drives supply and supply, in turn, creates demand.
In promoting domestic and international circulations, the Chinese economy has become much more domestically driven and the performance of China's development has been significantly enhanced.
In 7 years since the 2008 global financial crisis, the contribution of China’s domestic demand to #GDP exceeded 100%, making domestic consumption the main driver of its growth.
In China, the ratio of foreign trade to #GDP dropped from 67% in 2006 to less than 32% in 2019, while the ratio of current account surplus to #GDP has come down from 9.9% in 2007 to less than 1% today.
The new #development paradigm is a strategic decision we have made based on the current stage and conditions of development in #China and with full consideration given to economic #globalization and changes in the external environment.
To beat the virus and promote global #recovery, we in the international community must close ranks and jointly respond to this crisis and meet the test.
#COVID19 once again shows that the interests of all countries are closely interwoven and that #humankind shares a common stake. Indeed, our world is an indivisible #community with a shared future.
President Xi Jinping is delivering a keynote speech at the #APEC CEO Dialogues through video link.  
Ambassador Caroline Wilson @CWilson_FCDO opened a vlog account to share her experience in China, including visits to Chinese cities during the pandemic. All in Chinese. Trendy and creative. Enjoy your stay in China! @ukinchina 🌞  
All impoverished counties in Sichuan Province have shaken off poverty, where over 1 million people moved above the poverty line each year on average. So far, 19 provincial regions in China have lifted all their counties out of poverty.
The 1st unmanned demo farm in #Shanghai. IoT, #5G, and AI makes farming more efficient, productive and environmentally friendly.
Some facts about China's law-based governance:  
All of us are indeed passengers in the same boat. When the wind is strong and the tides are high, we must be even more focused on our direction. We must keep pace and work as a team to break the waves and navigate steadily toward a brighter future.
China will scale up its nationally determined contributions and strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. You can count on China to keep its promise.
China is prepared to take on international responsibilities befitting its level of development, and will continue to make extraordinary efforts to address climate change.
#Globalwarming will not stop due to #COVID19. To tackle climate change, we must never relax our efforts.
In so doing, China will create more opportunities and space for global #recovery and #growth.
China will not shut its door of #OpeningUp; it will embrace the world with more open arms. China will be more vigorous in integrating with the global market and will take greater initiative in deepening international cooperation.
We will redouble efforts to expand domestic demand, deepen reform across the board and promote innovation in science and technology to add impetus to China's economic growth.
#Development holds the master key to all problems. All our efforts, from clearing the impact of #COVID19 and getting back to a normal life, to ending conflicts and humanitarian crises, ultimately depend on people-centered development.
We need to leverage the new biz forms&models triggered by the pandemic, strengthen cooperation on scientific&technological innovation, and nurture an open, fair, equitable&nondiscriminatory biz environment to bring about common development of higher quality&stronger resilience.
Under the current situation, we need to stand firm for building an open world economy. We need to uphold the multilateral trading system with the #WTO at its core and reject abuse of the "national security" concept for protectionist purposes.
The practice of using the pandemic to pursue "de-globalization" or clamor for "economic #decoupling" and "parallel systems" will end up hurting one's own interests and the common interests of all.
We will open in Xiamen, Fujian Province a #BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution innovation center to advance cooperation on policy coordination, personnel training and project development, and we welcome the active participation of fellow BRICS countries.
China will work with other parties to flesh out the #BRICS Partnership on New Industrial Revolution at a faster pace.
We will work with other BRICS countries both online and offline to advance collective vaccine research and trials, set up plants, authorize production and recognize each other's standards.
To support the development of the #BRICS Vaccine R & D Center, China has designated its own national center.
We need to overcome division with unity, replace bias with reason and stamp out the "political virus". In this way, we will pool the maximum global #synergy to beat the virus.
Acts of politicization, stigmatization, blame-shifting and scapegoating only serve to disrupt overall global #cooperation against the virus.
Our fight over the past year proves that as long as we stand in unity and follow science, we can control the spread of the virus and offset its impact.
With concerted efforts, we will foster a peaceful and stable environment for development.
We need to work through consultation and negotiation to address differences. We need to oppose interference in others' internal affairs, as well as unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction.
We need to champion the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security.
It is important that countries rise above #ideology and respect each other's choices of social system, economic model and development path consistent with their national conditions.
We must hold high the banner of multilateralism, and defend the purposes and principles of the Charter of the #UN. We must endeavor to safeguard the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law.
Facing the choice between #multilateralism and #unilateralism, and between justice and #hegemony, BRICS countries must stand up for equity and justice in the world.
We must keep people's welfare close to heart and pursue the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind. Through concrete actions, we will contribute our share to making the world a better place.
We remain convinced that the theme of our times, #peace and #development, has not changed, and that the trend toward #multipolarity and economic #globalization cannot be turned around.
Human society is going through the most serious #pandemic in the past century. The world economy is witnessing the worst #recession since the #GreatDepression in the 1930s.
Right now, the world is caught between a #pandemic of the century and momentous changes never seen in the last one hundred years. The international landscape keeps evolving in profound ways.
President Xi Jinping is delivering a speech at the 12th #BRICSSummit through video link.  
"If you want to get rich, build a road first." In the digital age, the #internet expressway becomes the road. TF1 recently reveals how Chinese farmers #livestream their #farmproduce, sharing China's experience with more people in the world.  
The South-North Water Diversion Project feeds Chinese in drier areas, including #Beijing, with clean water. The water source protection areas also changed for the better, with purer water, lusher mountains and more wildlife. #Environment & #Development can go hand in hand.  
Thank you, Consul General Ellison for your bravity to save people's life.  
Happy 75th birthday to #UNESCO! #Peace must be founded upon dialogue & mutual understanding. China will, as always, promote education, science & technology and culture, and work with all countries to contribute to the #humanistic missions in the world.
#Solidarity and cooperation is the only way to defeat the #coronavirus. Since the outbreak of #COVID19, China has exported 38.6 billion masks, 610 million protective gowns and 12,000 ventilators to the #US.  
#China has become part of Mirko Turrina's life after 16 years. Take a tour around his company in Tianjin and find what keeps him staying in China.
The victory over #poverty in #Xinjiang cannot be secured without the local's hard work. The story of Ablikim's family is a case in point. This is how all the over 3 million poor people and 32 poor counties in Xinjiang lifted themselves out of poverty.
#RCEP, the world's largest free trade deal, was signed. A reflection of the commitment to free trade & multilateral trading system. A booster for high-level economic integration in the region.  
Beijing's #autumn.  🌞Amazingly beautiful.  
#Pudong's opening-up and development in the past 30 years was powered by liberalizing mindset and deepening reforms. It represents a path of further opening-up, breaking convention and innovations and breakthroughs.  
On Nov 11th, or #DoubleEleven, online payments through NetsUnion and China UnionPay soared to 1.77 trillion yuan ($267.22 billion), and 675 million packages were delivered altogether.  
Congratulations!
We urge the #US to strictly abide by the one-China principle & the three China-US joint communiques, stop doing or saying anything detrimental to #peace and #stability across the #TaiwanStrait and China-US relations, and promptly halt its steps down the wrong & dangerous path.
China will resolutely fight back against all attempts that undermine China's core interests and interfere in China's #internal affairs.
For #Pompeo, compared with his own #political interests, the fundamental interests of the Chinese and American people are just nothing. He is only interested in making up one #lie after another to torpedo China-US relations and peace and stability across the #TaiwanStrait.  
This serves as the basis for China and the US to recognize each other and to establish diplomatic relations.
As per the 1979 Joint Communique of the United States of America and the People's Republic of China (#Normalization Communique), the United States recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China as the #sole legal Government of China.
The one-China principle is the political #underpinning of China-US relations.
This is an objective #fact and a basic #norm governing international relations. Based on the one-China principle, China has established diplomatic ties with 180 countries.
There is only #OneChina in the world, and #Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. The Central People's Government of the #PRC is the sole legitimate government representing China.
The #UK and #Australia need to know it has been over 20 years since #HongKong's return to the motherland. They should stop to expect Hong Kong compatriots not to identify with the "one country" and not to pledge allegiance to their country and the #HKSAR any more.
It is common practice worldwide that civil servants pledge #allegiance to their country. No country will allow those who have betrayed their oaths and broken laws to #collude with foreign forces for #separatist activities to sit as lawmakers or hold public offices.
President Xi Jinping delivered a speech through video link at the Third Edition of #ParisPeaceForum.  Full text:  
Many foreign friends have joined the #DoubleEleven2020, including #TaylorSwift.
So cool!
Seriously? I know many were counted in the #CleanNetwork unknowingly. Backdoor, monopoly and ideology. Talking Clean, acting Dirty. This is coercion.  
A nationwide travel ban from #China took effect on January 31, when the #US only had less than 10 cases. Now, with over #10millioncases, the US demands over 100 flights to China every week.
We must keep pace with the times to ensure that the Forum remains a #ShiningExample of China-Africa relations, and strive for high quality in our cooperation.
By doing so, we will bring about a more equitable and reasonable international order and an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal #security and common #prosperity.
We need to embrace our responsibilities and work toward a community with a shared future for mankind. We must safeguard the #UN's central role in intl and multilateral affairs, defend basic norms governing intl relations, and uphold #multilateralism, #fairness and #justice.
We need to pursue #WinWin cooperation to build a China-Africa community of development for all. China will continue to support Africa in enhancing #infrastructure, advancing #industrialization and building up capacity for #IndependentDevelopment.
We need to tide over the current challenge together and build a China-Africa community of health for all. China will work with Africa to put greater focus on public #health, economic reopening and improvement of livelihoods.
We need to strengthen #solidarity and build a stronger #community with a shared future.
The past 20 years of #FOCAC have shown, countries who are still in the process of #development can build a better life for their people. With self-reliance and exploration, China and African countries can find our own path toward #prosperity that suits our national conditions.
As many as 21,000 Chinese medical personnel have worked, or are working, in 48 African countries, providing treatment to around 220 million African people.
The #AU Conference Center, the Mombasa-Nairobi railway, and the Maputo-Katembe Bridge, key projects in Africa's drive to achieve the "Century Dream", have been dedicated one after another, and stand as monumental #symbols of the shared development of #China and #Africa.
These #infrastructures have made a big difference in Africa's economic and social #development.
China has built for Africa over 6,000 kilometers of #railways and the same mileage of roads, nearly 20 ports and over 80 large-scale power plants, and more than 130 medical facilities, 45 stadiums and 170 or so schools.
Bound by #brotherly ties, all #FOCAC members are equal and treat each other with respect, regardless of size or strength. We have firmly supported each other on issues concerning core interests and major concerns.
Over the two decades, #FOCAC has established itself as a pacesetter for cooperation with #Africa, a champion of #multilateralism, and a fine example of mutually beneficial cooperation.
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a speech at the reception commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (#FOCAC).  
As the head of #Sinovac's Brazilian partner the Butantan Institute said, the volunteer's death is not related to the vaccine. It was suicide. Some rushed to allege that Sinovac's vaccine is not safe. Any hidden agenda here?

#ThisIsChina International eyes on #Shenzhen's 40 years   Sergey Shakhray  
From #CIIE2020 you can see #innovation keeps China on the move.  
We welcome all parties to capitalize on China's development opportunity and make active endeavors to deepen cooperation with China.
China will remain committed to a #winwinstrategy of opening-up. It will seek #development impetus from the world and contribute more to the world with its own development.
Now, China is speeding up efforts to foster a new development paradigm with #domesticcirculation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other.
China cannot be separated from the world in achieving development, and the world also needs China for #prosperity.
We need to follow the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, and build a world where global affairs are discussed by all, the governance system built by all, and development fruits shared by all.
We need to act to champion #multilateralism, improve #globalgovernance and uphold the #internationalorder.
Each #civilization is distinct and none is superior to others. We need to promote mutual learning between our civilizations and enhance good-neighborliness and friendship between our countries. This allows us to enhance public support for the SCO's long-term development.
We need to be guided by the vision of innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development and open up more opportunities for practical cooperation to facilitate #economicrecovery and betterment of people's lives.
True #development is development for all and good development is #sustainable.
We need to firmly oppose interference by external forces in the domestic affairs of #SCO members under whatever pretexts.
We need to firmly support countries concerned in their law-based efforts to steadily advance major domestic political agenda, and firmly support countries in safeguarding #politicalsecurity and #socialstability.
China will actively consider #SCO countries' need for vaccines to help protect people's safety and health in our countries.
China proposes that hotline contacts be created between #SCO members' centers for disease control (#CDCs) for timely updates on cross-border transmission of communicable diseases.
We need to strengthen our joint response to #COVID19, support each other's containment efforts, and deepen exchanges and cooperation in epidemic monitoring, scientific research, and disease control and treatment.
The #SCO is required to carry forward the #ShanghaiSpirit and deepen solidarity and collaboration. Together, we will contribute more to the stability and development of countries in the region and take more steps toward building a community with a shared future for mankind.
History has proven and will continue to prove that good-neighborliness will prevail over a beggar-thy-neighbor approach, mutually beneficial cooperation will replace zero-sum game, and #multilateralism will win over #unilateralism.
Humanity lives in a #globalvillage where the interests and destinies of all countries are intertwined. People across the world increasingly yearn for a better life. The trend toward peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit is unstoppable.
President Xi Jinping delivered a speech through video link at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization #SCO.  
The real #China has surprised many people the first time they met. An #openingup China welcomes you and will surely impress you.  
#COVID19 did not bring down business' interests in the #China market. As the #CIIE2020 is wrapping up, there's a review what exhibitors said about their stay in #Shanghai.  
Facts & figures show what we have achieved over the past 5 years. This is our way: set up the plan, follow it and accomplish the goals. Will keep up the work following the 14th #FiveYearPlan.

Yang Ha'na, 81, says she shops everything online once she learned how to do it. 2 to 4 delivery boxes per day. Different dresses everyday for a month. Never underestimate the "silver economy" in China.   
🇯🇵 companies outnumber others. 🇺🇸 businesses take up the largest exhibition area.
What makes this #CIIE special? Half of the exhibits made their world debut. 674 exhibitors & 1351 purchasers from 64 countries joined offline or online. 861 letters of intent for cooperation reached already.
It is valued by the Central Party Committee and is taken in the Proposal for the Plan.
On China's 14th #FiveYearPlan: Netizens' messages were adopted in the Proposals. Li Dianbo, a village deputy generalsecretary of the Communist Party of China in Inner Mongolia, proposed online a "mutual care model" for the rural, elderly population.  
#Spanish Ambassador to China Mr Dezcallar joined the livestreaming to share the Spanish culture and cuisine. Within just 3 minutes, 3.5 million yuan (around €446K) of wine were sold. The speed and volume amazed a wine producer, who at first thought there was a technical error.  
 
#CIIE2020 comes at the time when #China and #Italy celebrate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties. Italian Ambassador to China Mr Ferrari wished the event a success through a video. It means a lot for both countries.  
Russian Ambassador to China Mr Denisov shared stories about #Russia in fluent Chinese. He spoke highly of the online platform for Chinese consumers to know about Russian products. Actually they have been sold well and got more and more popular in China.  
 
France came out on top of the 5 European countries with 43 mil yuan (around € 5.48mil)worth of products sold. Former Prime Minster Raffarin sent a video to the event, appreciating the creative livestreaming during #CIIE. Indeed, trade has been deepening China-France friendship.  
140 million yuan(around €17.85mil) worth of imported products from 🇮🇹,🇫🇷,🇷🇺,🇪🇸&🇩🇪 were sold online within just 2 days!  Attractive products plus CCTV anchors & e-commerce influencers made the intl shopping spree a highlight during the China International Import Expo. #CIIE2020.  
H. E. Mr. Eugenio Bregolat, former #Spanish ambassador to #China served for three times, is telling his story. He has witnessed China's tremendous development and changes, and is deeply in love with Chinese culture. Seeing is believing.
Upholding Multilateralism to Tackle Global Challenges—State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a speech at the Global Advisory Board Meeting of the School of Public Policy and Management of Tsinghua University.   
 
What has happened since the start of #COVID19 has proved time and again that humankind is a community with a shared future, multilateralism is the right way forward, and that strengthened global governance is an urgent necessity.
Throughout its response to the coronavirus, China has put lives and well-being of its people front and center, and has taken a science-based approach guided by a strong sense of responsibility.
China has sent 36 medical expert teams to 34 countries, and extended assistance to over 150 countries and international organizations.
Working with other countries, we put in place "fast tracks" for travels, "green corridors" for the flow of goods and "lifelines" for the transportation of food, to keep industrial and supply chains stable and open and facilitate speedy global economic recovery.
China has withstood this tough test. We hope our experience will be a source of confidence and strength for the global fight against #COVID19.
Countries, regardless of their size, wealth and strength, are all equal members of the international community. They have equal rights to develop, to pursue a better life, and to participate in world affairs.
The global governance system must be built by all countries. No country should pursue selfish interest or seek unilateral dominance.
It is important to increase the voice and representation of developing countries, ensure that countries enjoy rights and opportunities while being bound by rules on an equal footing, and different countries, classes and groups can share the dividends of global governance.
International relations must not be allowed to return to the law of the jungle. Relations among countries and their interests should only be regulated by mechanisms and rules.
A coherent global governance structure should be rooted in respecting sovereign equality, non-interference in domestic affairs, peaceful settlement of disputes and other basic norms of international relations. All countries should jointly uphold intl fairness and justice.
Humankind lives on this one and only planet. Countries, increasingly interdependent in an indivisible community, need to look out for each other and work in solidarity.
Countries must discard ideological biases, and transcend ethnic and cultural differences. They should uphold the values of peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom shared by all of us, and jointly look after our home planet and make it better.
China is not selective with multilateralism. Instead, we embrace the principle of safeguarding the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and UN's central role in international affairs.
We will achieve the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and win the battle against poverty by the end of this year. Extreme poverty will be eradicated for the first time in China's history.
While working hard toward our own goals, we also empathize with the rest of the world and join hands with other countries in the pursuit of common development.
This is a logical choice as China's economy enters a new stage with growth primarily driven by domestic consumption. It also reflects the inherent trend in the development of the major economies.
China has decided to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other.
As the new paradigm takes shape, the China market will grow in size and capacity, thus providing broader space for countries around the world to access the market and share the opportunities.
With domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other and the mutual opening-up between China and the world, fresh impetus will be injected to both the Chinese and world economy.
Humanity now stands at a new crossroads. The world today needs #multilateralism, #solidarity and #cooperation more than ever before. Every choice we make, and every action we take today, will shape the world tomorrow.
On #China's 14th Five-Year Plan : How does decision-making process work?  #Zhejiang as an example:  
The heavy Medal represents the deep friendship between Chinese and Cambodian people and symbolizes the close relationship between the two countries.
President Xi Jinping held an awarding ceremony of the #FriendshipMedal of the People's Republic of China for the Cambodian Queen Mother Norodom Monineath Sihanouk.  
Chinese exhibits at the #CIIE show how challenges like #COVID19 serve to drive innovation & scientific advancement. The CT scanners identify human body automatically & produce quality images. Negative pressure ambulances reduce changes of viral infection. Tech saves time & life.  
Chinese consumers can make better-informed choices when it comes to #food.  Imported meat has their own ID. Milk harvesting and processing can be seen on screen. The lobster giant swimming in the tank is a #spokesperson for his kind back home.  
Futuristic designs make #CIIE debut. The unimaginable have become reality. Kayaks can be folded into backpacks. #3D knitting machines make a dress within 90 minutes. Airless tires never go flat and need no maintenance. The last one seems to be a must-have.  
What world leaders say about the 3rd #CIIE.
#Innovation is the primary driver for development. To build a highway bridge among canyons and over a lake in Guizhou Province, #drones were used to link the pilot cables.   
The Chinese taste buds are ready for foreign spices! Chilies from Rwanda have been a star in the #CIIE these years, joining the HOT family from India, Mexico, the ROK, etc. Maybe there will be new flavors of #Laoganma soon.  
China's #FAST, the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, has identified over 240 pulsars, and helped the work of scientists, of China and around the world. Its sensitive observations may reveal more mysteries around the #BigBang.
On #China's 14th Five-Year Plan:  
Simple #CIIE hand gestures, easy access to international imports. Each and every year, #Shanghai is welcoming our friends.
Medical supplies for #COVID19 have all been handed over! They are Chinese government donation to women & children in Africa, through Organization of African First Ladies for Development(OAFLAD). China-Africa relations will surely grow from strength to strength, as always.  
A year later back to #Shanghai for #CIIE, even it means 20h flight&28 days in isolation. The Italian jewelry artists with Russo Cammei show us the beauty&friendship transcend time&borders. Their shell carvings are great gifts for the 50th birthday of China-Italy diplomatic ties.  
Plant trees. We Chinese are serious about it. Schoolkids, villagers and officials are all committed. Simple words but strong actions. We do it to make our home beautiful and save our shared planet.  
China stands ready to conclude high-standard free agreements with more countries in the world.
China will continue to make its foreign-related legal framework more open and transparent, strengthen intellectual property protection, and better protect the lawful rights and interests of foreign investors.
In the wake of #COVID19, China has adopted a range of pro-business relief policies that apply equally to all companies registered in China.
We will deepen reform and innovation in trade and investment liberalization and facilitation. We will shorten its catalog of technologies prohibited or restricted from import to create a favorable environment for the free flow of technologies across borders.
China will introduce a negative list for cross-border services trade and open still wider in areas like the digital economy and the Internet.  
Our aim is to turn China market into a market for the world, a market shared by all, and a market accessible to all. This way, we will be able to bring more positive energy to the global community.
China will stay committed to openness, cooperation and unity for win-win results. We will steadfastly expand all-round opening up and explore more efficient ways to connect domestic and foreign markets and share factors of production and resources.  
The Chinese economy is steadily picking up, as evidenced by the positive overall growth in the first 3 quarters, including a 0.7% growth in foreign trade and a 5.2% rise in paid-in foreign investment.  
The Chinese people have exerted extraordinary efforts and major strategic gains in controlling the coronavirus.
China has a population of 1.4 billion and a middle-income group that exceeds 400 million. The vastly huge China market is the most promising in the world. Total import into China is estimated to top 22 trillion USD in the coming decade.  
We will do so not only to meet China's own development needs but also for the greater benefit of people in all countries.
China has set out to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. What we envision is not a development loop behind closed doors, but more open domestic and intl circulations.  
Guided by a vision of global governance based on extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, we need to safeguard the multilateral trading system with the WTO as its cornerstone, improve the rules of global economic governance, and build an open world economy.  
Big countries need to lead by example, major economies need to act on sound principles, and developing countries need to play an active part in promoting opening up and sharing responsibilities. It is by working together that we will advance common development of our world.
The overwhelming trend for countries to move toward openness and cooperation remains unchanged. All countries need to come together to jointly tackle risks and challenges, strengthen cooperation and communication, and embrace greater openness.
Looking back at history, humanity has always been able to forge ahead despite risks, disasters and headwinds, and humanity shall and will continue to stride forward.
As scheduled and confident in the containment protocols that have been put in place, #China is hosting this global trade event. It demonstrates China's sincere desire to share its market opportunities with the world and contribute to global economic recovery.  
The 3rd China International Import Expo is on! President Xi Jinping is delivering a keynote speech via video link at the opening ceremony. #CIIE2020  
From poverty to prosperity. Shibadong, the village where targeted poverty alleviation was put forward by President Xi and the #CPC, has turned its rich beauty into higher income of local ethnic Miao people.
Its recipe: top-level design plus public opinions. Its feature: unprecedented scale, number of participants and diversity in forms.
The compilation of the 14th #FiveYearPlan represents the democratic decision-making process in China.  
General Secretary and President Xi instructed to combine top-level design and public opinions, and stressed the need to broaden channels for the public to express their views, concerns and expectations.  
From July to Sep, President Xi hosted 7 symposiums for soliciting proposals for the Plan on #China's development. He sat down with entrepreneurs, non-CPC personnel, scientists, education, cultural, health and sports experts, and grassroots representatives, including deliverymen.  
Over 130 reports on major subjects were produced based on studies about the current situation and in the interest of people's life in the next 5 years. Research institutes were entrusted to do the job and non-CPC members were consulted for their inputs.
Everyone's voice can be heard. For the first time in history, a two-week campaign was launched in mid-August to seek public input online. It received over 1 million comments on extensive topics close to daily life. The reason is simple: People's happiness is the #CPC's mission.
The great changes in Xiadang, a small town in #Fujian Province, reflect the path to poverty alleviation in China and how the Chinese President and the #CPC place great attention to the course.  
Daily life with artworks, this is what Nico shows us about #Chongqing. The narration and recording techniques can make the city even cooler! More and more people have fun while staying in China.  
A. Miguet & G. Garon of France 2 in China shared their story of #Wuhan.   
We believe that #China will make even greater contribution to world #FoodSecurity.
I don't think there are many countries in the world that still see the #US as a force for good. The world is watching US #democracy and #HumanRights in pandemic response and election.  
Small buckwheat, big industry. Ms Sun Xiaoyan gets the idle workforce involved. With her wheelchair, Shi Zaohua encouraged others to keep hope alive by working. In China, in poverty alleviation, just as in any other fields, women hold up half the sky.
The #US is really good at implementing the "Attack China" strategy, but really bad at facing up to the reality and handling the #COVID19 pandemic.
A lie repeated a thousand times is a lie after all. The origin of the coronavirus is still unknown and unclear. What is known and clear is the time-line of China's #COVID19 response, which will stand the test of time and history.
As #WHO experts have concluded and many international media outlets have agreed, China's timely, effective and robust measures have not only contained the spread of the virus at home significantly, but also contributed to the global efforts.
When the neighboring provinces of #Hubei have controlled the epidemic, resumed normal life and restored economy, the far-off US, on the opposite, has reported over 9 million confirmed cases and 230,000 deaths. So whose fault is it?
One thing that's crystal clear is that there was only 1 confirmed case in the #US when #Wuhan began the lockdown on Jan. 23. There were no more than 10 confirmed cases in the US when it suspended flights to China.
 
David Stilwell's smear and attack on #China is so crazy that it has gone far beyond the bottom line of state-to-state relations and the basics of being a decent man.
No one is better at influence, interference and coercion than the #US. In all the areas that Mr. Stilwell mentioned in his speech, the US is the real #Thanos. No need to disguise itself as a victim.
It is just because of its persistent and continued hegemony and bullying that the #US dare to distort facts and make up lies in such an unscrupulous way.
If the #US is truly democratic, why does it ignore the voice of the majority of its people and watch over 230,000 Americans die from #COVID19 without taking effective measures?
If the US is truly free, why does #GeorgeFloyd hail "I can't breathe"? Why is Martin Luther King's  "I have a dream" still a dream?
If the #US is truly ruled by law, why does the American people still suffer from excessive enforcement of the police, gun abuses and mass shootings? Why does it maliciously repress Chinese private companies in the name of national security?
And why does the #US Department of Justice conduct investigations based on presumption of guilt instead of facts, requiring 94 regional judicial departments to file at least one or two lawsuits against #China every year?
It is so naive to believe that one could #MakeAmericaGreatAgain through flagrant smear and slander against China. It's also very ignorant to think that the #US could sever the flesh-and-blood bond between the #CPC and the Chinese people by sowing discord among them.
#China has no intention to interfere in #US' internal affairs. But just like one can hardly change one's own partner, how could the US daydream about changing a major country like China which has nearly 5 times the size of its population and 20 times the length of its history?
Fruitful video consultations with my #Kazakh counterpart, Mr. Abdrakhmanov Askar. Upholding our permanent comprehensive strategic partnership, we agreed to have close cooperation in press and information service.

As the 5th plenum of 19th #CPC Central Committee just concluded, have a look at the key takeaways from the Communique:  
"China-assisted #infrastructure hasn't led the country into a debt trap." The US should act, not just claim, to be a "force for good" in the #IndoPacific.  
President Rajapaksa said #SriLanka's foreign policy is "based on neutrality". It's "not ready to compromise independence, sovereignty & territorial integrity in maintaining foreign relations".  
#Shanghai will welcome international guests again to the 3rd #CIIE soon. Easy access based on high-tech to ensure their safe stay.
Beautiful scene for tourists. Poverty away from locals. It was high-speed railway that brought changes to this remote village in #Guangxi, China.  
After 20 years in China, Brian is telling us his experience, how he sees China and how he bridges #China and the #US.
Some in the #US constantly and tirelessly smear China about the so-called human rights abuses against ethnic minorities such as the #Uyghurs. Sometimes they say it's "forced labor". Sometimes it's "detention camps". Now, even more appalling, they accuse China of "genocide".
Such nonsense only demonstrates their prejudice and ignorance. How pathetic!
Some basic knowledge. There are 56 ethnic groups in China. The equality of all ethnicities and the freedom to use and develop their own languages are enshrined in the Chinese Constitution.
From 20102018, the #Uyghur population in Xinjiang grew from 10.17mln12.72mln, an increase of 2.55mln/25%, higher than that of the whole population in Xinjiang, which is 14%, and much higher than that of the Han population, which is 2%. How is it in any way "genocide"?
The local government helps organize the #Uyghur people to find jobs so that they could live a better life. What kind of "forced labor" is this? Perhaps these American politicians believe that ethnic minorities only deserve forced unemployment and forced poverty?
By smearing and attacking the #CPC, a party with 92 million members and an approval rating of over 90%, Mr. #Pompeo is making himself an enemy of at least 1/5 of the world population.
But he should understand that poverty and backwardness should not be the byword for any particular country, and development and strength should not be the privilege of any particular country either.
It is so clear that the real purpose of #Pompeo's lies and smears about China is to force China back to poverty and backwardness, and drag the world into confrontation and division.  
China is expecting its visionary 14th Five-Year Plan. It showcases the democratic policy-making and will respond to the wishes of the Chinese people based on their needs.  
What will happen when drones meet cotton fields? Reports from #Xinjiang show us the answer.
Amb. Craft's groundless allegation is an insult to all int'l staff members. UN system has 2,531 staff members from the US, including 19 Under Secretaries General & Assistant Secretaries General, more than any other member state. Is Craft putting their integrity under scrutiny?
Likewise, the #US should stop attempting to change China or deprive the Chinese people's rights to develop and pursue a better life.
China takes great pride in its civilization of 5,000 years and has full confidence in its own path, theory, system, and culture. China never wanted to become another #US nor does it want to replace the US or threaten western democracy.
Mr. O'Brien's words once again prove how ignorant he is of China.
Mr. O'Brien said in his article in #ForeignAffairs that conventional wisdom in the US held that it was only a matter of time before China would change. However, China is increasingly using its leverage to control American speech and represents a threat to western democracy.  
My friend Hou Yanqi, Chinese Ambassador to #Nepal, singing a beautiful Nepali song in local language.
Follow Daniel and Noel into #Tibet to discover local attractions, sights, food, traditional culture and so much more.  
Rather than smear China, how about the #US does something about the poor prison workers who work overtime and are paid as little as 23 cents an hour? How about the US offers its ethnic minorities equal job opportunities and treatments?
Every citizen deserves the lawful rights to live a better life through hard work regardless of their race or religion. This is how a country upholds its people's dignity and values their human rights. In this respect, there's so much that the #US could learn from #China.
Some people in the #US have sunk so low that they have to make up one lie to cover up another.  
As always, China will continue to firmly uphold multilateralism, support the work of the UN and defend the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. #UN75

Why is it so difficult for them to face up to the truth and to be honest?
It's already exposed that the so-called "satellite photos" they cited are only interactive maps. The so-called "detention centers" are actually the buildings of the local administrative offices, high school campuses and residential areas.  
The so-called "concentration camps" are just a fiction cooked up by anti-China scholars and institutions such as Adrian Zenz and #ASPI.

During the #NationalDay&Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, nearly 700 mln Chinese people traveled to visit family, friends or for sight-seeing. Transaction by Alipay in department stores increased by nearly 250% from last month&transaction by China UnionPay reached 2.16 trillion yuan.  
Scapegoating others won't defeat the virus or save patients.
But what about Dr. Anthony Fauci & US whistle-blowers? As Dr. Rick Bright wrote in a Washington Post article: "Of all the tools required for an effective U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic, one that is sorely missing is the truth".
It is precisely because China respects science&facts and puts life&people first that we've achieved major strategic outcomes in combating the epidemic. Medical experts who made tremendous contributions to this fight like Dr. Zhong Nanshan have been honored with national awards.
On Jan. 23, as #Wuhan was locked down, there were only 9 confirmed cases outside #China, including 1 in the #US. On Feb. 2, when the US closed its borders to Chinese citizens, it had only confirmed a dozen cases.
The most stringent closure and traffic control were imposed on the exit routes from #Wuhan and Hubei Province. All 31 provinces, regions & municipalities activated Level 1 emergence response.
Once the high-level panel of experts determined person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus after thorough research & investigation, China immediately and resolutely shut all exit routes from #Wuhan.
The timeline of #China's epidemic response is clear. More findings show the epidemic broke out in various places around the world. China was the first to report the outbreak, identify the pathogen & share the genome sequence with the world.  
Pictures my friend took with her #Huawei moblie phone in a tea garden and around in #Zhejiang, where our President said, nothing is as precious as lush mountains and clear waters.  
 
From a herdsman family and learned to be a helicopter pilot. This #Tibetan young lady is showing you what #Lhasa looks like from the sky. Cool!
And #Tibet, #Xinjiang Uyghur and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions saw the fastest growth in expenditures.
637 million trips to tourist attractions, 2.16 trillion Yuan ($318.1 billion) in UnionPay online transactions. That's what happened during the #GoldenWeek holiday in China, when the #NationalDay meets the Mid-Autumn Festival.
 
#China will continue to work together with #COVAX partners and contribute its share to the global fight against the pandemic to safeguard all human beings' safety and health.
#China will also strengthen #vaccine cooperation with relevant countries through the #COVAX network.
Even when #China is leading the world with several #vaccines in advanced stages of R&D and with ample production capacity, it still decided to join #COVAX.
Therefore, #China has maintained close communication with #COVAX with a positive attitude towards joining it.
To that end, we have solemnly pledged to make #vaccines developed and deployed by #China a global public good, which will be provided to developing countries as a priority.
#China continues to focus on ensuring that developing countries have equal access to appropriate, safe and effective #vaccines.
Currently, the #COVID19 pandemic still poses a severe threat to the safety and health of people in all countries.
This is an important step #China has taken to uphold the concept of a shared community of health for all and to honor its commitment to turn #COVID19 vaccines into a global public good.
#China just signed an agreement with #Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, officially joining #COVAX.
We appreciate the voices of justice and fairness at the UN. We believe justice instead of prejudice will prevail in the end.  
UK: 46% British Muslims: With racism and discrimination, life is so hard.  
Germany: 1904-1908 Colonizers killed over 100000 Namibian natives.  In 2004 no "reparation", replaced with "healing of wounds".  
USA:  1963-- I have a dream 2020-- I can't breathe.  
Those lecturing others should first examine themselves. They cannot cover up their entrenched poor human rights records by blaming China. A few examples:
BAN, SANCTION, ARREST....Disregard allies or non-allies 1987   TOSHIBA 2014   ALSTOM  Now    HUAWEI, TIKTOK, WECHAT Who's NEXT?
Certain countries have their own human rights in disaster while shamelessly smearing others. They have weaponized "human rights" as a card to play politics. Just look at Chinese people of all ethnics enjoying the National Day. They have the best say in China's human rights.  
A small group of countries led by #US have completely FAILED again in their attempt to smear China's #humanrights record. Nearly 70 nations stood with China in the UN. Time to put away your arrogance and prejudice, and heed the world's call for justice!
View of China from high-speed train.  
#kungfupanda for the #NationalDay.
Look, these are the Chinese people! Listen, this is the voice of the Chinese people.  
Yesterday #US reported over 47,000 #COVID19 cases and 600 deaths. Feeling heartbroken for the ongoing hardship of these patients. Sincerely hope all of them can receive the same "finest" treatment and care as the #President.
Over 800 million Chinese people have been lifted out of poverty in the past 40 years. Hope China's experience  and practice may somehow provide some food for thought to inform others' #povertyalleviation endeavors.   
Saddened to learn #President and the #FirstLady of the #US tested positive. Hope they both have a speedy recovery and will be fine.
Serbian President Vucic: In #Washington, "probably the most inconvenient place to say something positive about China", I said we have excellent relations with China. That speaks about the strength of our friendship.   
On US Secretary of State #Pompeo's Erroneous Remarks about China:  
As the Chinese people celebrate both the #NationalDay and the Mid-Autumn Festival, 1000 drones took to the air in #Guangzhou in formations of Dr. Zhong Nanshan & other medical workers to salute heroes in fighting #COVID19. Cool!  
Tourism revenue reached ¥76.65 bln (about $11.26 bln), a recovery of 68.9% of the revenue gained in the same period in 2019.  We contained #COVID19. And so will the world. Stay strong!
China saw a total of 97 mln domestic tourist trips made on Thursday, the first day of an eight-day #GoldenWeek holiday. The figure was 73.8% of the trips made during the same period last year.
Chinese cities share the beautiful moment of Mid-Autumn festival:  
China proposes the convening in 2025 of another Global Leaders' Meeting on #GenderEquality and Women's Empowerment.
In China, the gender gap in compulsory education has been largely closed. Women account for over 40 percent of the country's workforce.
Equality between men and women is a basic state policy in China. We have put in place a legal system comprising over 100 laws and regulations for fully protecting women's rights and interests.
In doing so, it will make women-related targets early harvest results of its #2030Agenda.
Fourth, we support the #UN in making women's development a priority. Our Organization should do more to eliminate violence, discrimination, poverty and other old problems, and to address new challenges such as bridging the gender digital divide.
Third, in pursuing development, we need to protect women's rights and interests and improve their lives, and ensure that women's development goes hand in hand with economic and social development. We need to support women and help them live their lives to the full.
We need to eliminate prejudice, discrimination and violence against women and make #GenderEquality a social norm and moral imperative observed by all.
Second, we need to strive for genuine #GenderEquality. Protection of women's rights and interests must become the commitment at the national level.
President Xi Jinping calls for taking the following four steps. First, we need to pay special attention to the health, social and psychological needs and working environment of frontline women medical workers.
At the height of the battle against #COVID19, the courage and hard work of tens of thousands of women medical workers in China have shown the very best of the medical profession. Their devotion and sacrifice have kept the nation intact through difficult times.
With their dedication and ingenuity, they have written heroic epics of saving people and protecting lives. They truly deserve our admiration.
Women have made extraordinary achievements in all fields. In the fight against #COVID19, female medical & epidemic control workers, researchers, community workers & volunteers over the world, braving danger & working around the clock, have fought at the front line of the battle.
President Xi Jinping is addressing the #UNGA high-level meeting via videoconference to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women held in #Beijing.  
#NationalDay greetings from China's #Mars probe #Tianwen1! A "selfie" to celebrate China's 71st birthday.  
Happy birthday, China!🌹  
China will adopt even more forceful policies and measures and strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, thus making greater efforts and contributions toward meeting the objectives of the #ParisAgreement.
China will continue to make extraordinary efforts to scale up its nationally determined contributions.
We have hit, ahead of schedule, the targets set for 2020 for tackling #ClimateChange and establishing protected areas.
China has taken an active part in global environmental governance. China takes seriously the obligations under environment-related treaties, including on #ClimateChange and #Biodiversity.
90% of terrestrial #ecosystem types and 85% of key wild animal populations are under effective protection.
We have made long-term, large-scale efforts to combat sandification and desertification, and we have effectively protected and restored the #wetlands. We now have one of the world's largest banks of genetic resources reserve.
China has always prioritized ecological progress and has rolled out strong policies and actions. For the last 10 years, China has topped the world in forest resource increase, with more than 70 million hectares of land afforested.
We need to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and accommodate developing countries' concerns over funding, technology and capacity building. We need to earnestly fulfill our commitments and focus on our targets.
Being at varying stages of development, developed and developing countries have different historical responsibilities and practical capabilities for addressing environmental issues.
We could strive to find development opportunities while preserving #Nature, and achieve win-win in both ecological conservation and high-quality development.
We need to continue with green development and increase the potential for high-quality economic recovery after #COVID19. We need to have determination and stay the course for #green, #inclusive and #sustainabledevelopment.
We must firmly safeguard the #UN-centered international system and uphold the sanctity and authority of international rules so as to enhance global governance on the environment.
Faced with the risks and challenges to the environment worldwide, countries share a common stake as passengers in the same boat and form a community with a shared future. Unilateralism finds no support; #cooperation is the right way forward.
We need to find a way for man and #Nature to live in harmony, balance and coordinate economic development and ecological protection.
A sound #ecosystem is essential for the prosperity of civilization. We need to take up our lofty responsibility for the entire human civilization, and we need to respect #Nature, follow its laws and protect it.
President Xi pointed out that #COVID19 reminds us of the interdependence between man and #Nature. It falls to all of us to act together and urgently advance protection and development in parallel to turn #Earth into a beautiful homeland for all creatures to live in harmony.
President Xi Jinping is making an important statement at the United Nations Summit on Biodiversity through video.  
#Wuhan reborn after #COVID19 with more strength and vitality. To celebrate the upcoming #NationalDay, people in the city gathered for a flash mob singing My Country and I.  
The #WorldBank revised up its forecast of China's economy this year to 2 percent in the latest report.  
The so-called forced labor in #Xinjiang is sheer fabrication. People of all ethnic groups, whether in China or the #US, should enjoy equal right to employment. They should not be deprived of the rights to pursue better lives through legitimate work.  
Look at what your gov did @statedeptpox. The world cares more about why the #US have been accused 400 times of violation of press freedom. Is this the way how the US gov treats journalists in accordance with laws?  
Q: Why is the US gov, self-claimed open & fair, so afraid of unarmed & harmless Chinese journalists? 1⃣ 
Excluded from free interviews, deprived of journalist status, deported on a large scale, Chinese journalists in the #US have suffered unprecedented suppression. Their aged parents & little babies are also terribly affected.  
Comments only make sense when they are based on truth and facts. The fact is, this lady is not a resident journalist. She came to China with a J-2 visa, which only allows temporary stay of 90 days. The denial of her visa renewal is absolutely #FAKENEWS.  
The Wall Street Journal used insulting language to openly spread racial discrimination. This is unacceptable to all Chinese, as unacceptable to the American people. The #WSJ still owes the Chinese people an apology. @statedeptspox, have you figured out the truth?  
The Australian correspondent portrayed China's interrogation under law as intimidation. But in fact, there was no infringement upon their personal safety & property security. And they were asked to leave upon the request of their embassy.  
Today, one journalist who has returned to China to heal from her trauma is still asking, when will her personal diary be returned?
3 months ago, the Australian #ASIO broke in & searched 4 Chinese journalists' home for 4 hours and took away one's daughter's "suspicious" iPad. Over a month passed, the result of "investigation" turned out to be "not guilty".
It is extremely unprofessional and irresponsible to retweet a report full of speculation and lies without verification. Following is a few examples:  
.@statedeptspox About some of your tweets, here are the answers:
Now the whole world sees so clearly it is exactly the #US that is clinging to the #ColdWar mentality and building a new wall.
This is a silly analogy. The lesson we learned from the reunification of #Germany 30 years ago is that countries should discard the #ColdWar mentality and ideological confrontation, and seek common development through inclusive cooperation.  
The #US politicians put their selfish political gains above people's lives, leading to millions of #COVID19 cases and over 200,000 lives lost. This is NOT #democracy.
Meanwhile, the #US gov is "of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%." This is NOT #democracy.
The CPC puts people first and brings #COVID19 under control to save as many lives at the earliest time possible. THIS is #democracy.
@StateDept One thing you need to understand. Without the right to survival, the talk of #HumanRights is hypocritical and is just nonsense. The CPC has lifted 800 million people out of poverty, who are heading for better lives. THIS is #democracy.
#China has achieved this year's #CO2emissiontarget ahead of schedule, another step in our green development approach.  We said it and we did it.  
#China is committed to upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea with regional countries. In the meantime, of course, we have the right to take necessary measures to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The #US has carried out highly provocative close-in reconnaissance missions, as close as only 88km from China's Guangdong. THIS is militarization.
In the first six months of this year alone, it has sent around 3000 fighter jets and 60 warships to the South China Sea, and conducted "dual carrier operation" there. THIS is militarization.
The #US has built over 400 military bases around the world. It has been frequently sending advanced aircraft and warships to the doorstep of other countries to flex muscles with threat of force.
@statedeptspox What does militarization mean? To deploy necessary defense facilities in one's own territory is the right of self-preservation as a sovereign state in accordance with international law. This is NOT militarization.
There is no great historical evil without a compensating historical progress. The future of humankind in the post-COVID era lies with the people of all countries. If we make the right choice, humanity as a whole will emerge stronger from #COVID19.
We will safeguard the existing #multilateralsecurityagreements and the consensus of various parties, reject #unilateralsanctions and long-arm jurisdiction.
China will continue its constructive engagement in resolving hotspot issues to safeguard overall #peace and #tranquility of the world.
We will overcome whatever difficulties that may lie ahead and take robust measures to deliver on our promise. We will launch a "#greenrevolution" in both lifestyle and development pattern, strive for "#greenrecovery" of the world economy after #COVID19.
President Xi Jinping announced that China will scale up its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions and aim to have #CO2emissions peak before 2030 and achieve #carbonneutrality before 2060. This is a strategic decision China has made for its own ecological progress.
China will fulfill its commitment on #energyconservation and #emissionreduction.
In addition, we will also deepen #internationalcooperation in #agriculture, #povertyreduction, #education, #womenandchildren, and #biodiversity in an effort to promote economic and social development in all countries, especially the developing ones.
China will set up Phase III of the South-South Cooperation Trust Fund, and give full support to the #UNGlobalGeospatialKnowledgeandInnovationCenter and the International Research Center of Big Data for #SustainableDevelopment Goals.
The #2030AgendaforSustainableDevelopment should feature more prominently in international cooperation.
China will advance high-quality #BeltandRoadcooperation and seek common development and prosperity with #BRI partners and China will promote #sustainabledevelopment across the world.
We will fully leverage our huge domestic market and massive consumption potential to provide a more resilient, dynamic and sustainable source of growth for the global economy, paving the way for a higher level of #connectivity and #interaction between China and the world.
China will accelerate the building of a #newdevelopmentparadigm with domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other to bolster the early recovery of the world economy.
We look forward to more countries supporting and joining the #GlobalInitiativeonDataSecurity proposed by China. We are ready to foster an open, secure and equitable environment for growing the digital economy.
China will actively engage in the global #governancereform to make the international order and system more fair, balanced and equitable. We will defend the legitimate rights and interests and development space of emerging markets and developing countries.
We will faithfully deliver our promise of making Chinese #vaccines a global public good, actively take part in multilateral cooperation on vaccine research, and contribute to the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in all developing countries.
China will vigorously engage in international cooperation against #COVID19. We will provide support for more countries and regions in fighting the virus.
President Xi Jinping stressed lately, "we must act, not just talk." China will always shoulder its responsibilities as a major country. We will take concrete actions to add stability and certainty to this volatile world, and give confidence and strength to #multilateralism.
Going forward, China will continue to pursue a higher level of opening-up across the board, share more benefits with the world, and contribute to global recovery through its own #development.
Guided by a win-win strategy of #openingup, China has been one of the best-performing economies in the improvement of business environment for the past two years.
China has learned from its experience in striving for modernization the importance of #openness and #cooperation in pushing forward #reform and #development. It is also what makes China as it is today.
To meet challenges by resorting to #protectionism and #decoupling leads only to self-imposed #isolation. The world's problems are not without solutions. What we need is better governance, greater opening-up and deeper cooperation.
All countries must keep to the right direction of #openness and #cooperation. The experience of China and many other countries shows that openness brings progress while seclusion leads to backwardness.
China will continue to use its experience and capability to help as much as it can all countries in need with all sincerity.
China is steadily implementing the #G20DebtServiceSuspensionInitiative for the Poorest Countries. We know that the health and prosperity of the Chinese people are closely entwined with that of people across the world.
China also provided emergency medical supplies to over 150 countries and international organizations and donated US$50 million respectively to the #WHO and the #UN #COVID19GlobalHumanitarianResponsePlan.
China has been at the forefront of the struggle against all kinds of viruses as well as international cooperation against #COVID19.
They are pushing the world into the abyss of ideological confrontation and #clashofcivilizations. Spreading the #politicalvirus of hatred and confrontation is as much a threat to the world as #coronavirus to mankind.
When #solidarity is needed the most, a few are creating divisions. They conjure up absurd allegations to discredit and put down other countries, blame others for their own problems, and walk away from their international obligations.
Only solidarity can help us win this battle that concerns the life and health of the people around the world and bring the world economy back on track at an early date.
All countries must stay on the right path to move forward with solidarity. Every country's future is increasingly interconnected. A recent poll by the #UN shows that 87 percent of those surveyed believe that #COVID19 has made international cooperation all the more imperative.
We stand against bullying practices. We believe that dialogue, consultation and win-win cooperation should prevail over confrontation, coercion and zero-sum game. A world with justice serves the common good. China is a staunch force for a fair and just world for all.
We support #multilateralism and are committed to the rule of law. We have joined almost all universal intergovernmental organizations and international conventions, and have signed more than 25,000 bilateral treaties.
We adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We never interfere in other countries’ internal affairs, nor allow other countries to interfere in our internal affairs.
In modern times, the old China suffered untold bitterness of humiliation and injustice. With the founding of the People's Republic, the Chinese people have not only stood tall in the world of nations, but have become a steadfast defender of international fairness and justice.
Those who think that they could flout and breach international rules simply because they have more muscles will eventually end up in the dustbin of history.
All countries, big or small, strong or weak, are equal members of the international community. All peoples, wherever they are, are entitled to a good life.
All countries must jointly defend the universal values of fairness and justice. The wheel of history has kept, and will keep, moving forward. Any attempt to resurrect hegemonism and return the world back to a jungle is doomed to fail.
China will stay firmly on the path of peaceful development, and work with other countries to oppose the narrow-minded approach that puts one country's interest first and the dangerous practice of zero-sum game.
Major countries shoulder a unique responsibility to safeguard peace and development, and should not seek their own security at the expense of others' security or deny other countries' right to development with bullying practices.
Challenges to peace should be resolved by pursuing common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and development deficit should be addressed with a new philosophy of innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all.
It has also actively and constructively engaged in the political settlement and mediation of international hotpots and played a leading role in tackling global challenges such as #ClimateChange.
China is a crucial participant of the #2030Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is the second largest financial contributor to #UN peacekeeping operations as well as an important troop provider, sending more than 40,000 personnel over the past three decades and more.
All countries must jointly uphold the theme of the times featuring peace and development.  As the first country to put its signature on the #UNCharter, China has made relentless efforts to safeguard peace and development of the world while benefiting from it.
This meets the shared interests of countries across the world, and is fully in line with the trend of our times and the future trajectory of our world. In a world of profound changes, China’s position is very clear.
President Xi also announced major proposals and initiatives on tackling global challenges and promoting common development. His statement attests to his sense of responsibility as the leader of a major country.
President Xi Jinping delivered an important address at the UN General Assembly. He reaffirmed China's firm commitment to support the #UN, safeguard multilateralism, and build a community with a shared future for mankind with all countries.
Certain country has turned the #UN, a solemn international forum, into a theater for self-serving political shows and an arena to provoke conflict and confrontation and to divide the world. Countries have expressed in various ways their opposition against such disgraceful acts.
Countries will end up in an even greater disaster if they choose to go it alone or even opt for a beggar-thy-neighbor approach. Unity and solidarity is the only choice for us all.
Countries have reaffirmed and reiterated the imperative of upholding multilateralism. Solidarity and cooperation is the only way for defeating the virus and achieving recovery.
The purposes and principles of the #UNCharter remain the overarching signpost toward global peace and development. Multilateralism is indisputably the foundation and pillar for the current international order.
It is broadly agreed that the #UN remains the best-equipped institution and platform in the international system, international law remains the most authoritative framework of rules governing state-to-state relations.
At the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, leaders from over 170 countries have come to valuable common understandings on a number of major principles and directions.
Our world is at another historic moment since #WorldWarII. No country should take this question lightly, and more important, everyone should avoid making the wrong choice.
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is delivering a speech at the opening session of the Lanting Forum on International Order and Global Governance in the Post #COVID19 Era.  
Dr. Zhong Nanshan's professional advice was adopted and he was awarded the Medal of the Republic, the top honor, and regarded as a hero. We hope Dr. #Fauci, the American Dr. Zhong, could also be respected and treated well.  
Fact check:  
The whole world knows that Secretary #Pompeo and the like have been lying, making up one lie after another to cover up their own failure.  
Big Earth Data in Support of the Sustainable Development Goals  
Working Together on Poverty Eradication, Promoting New Progress of South-South Cooperation- Keynote Speech by State Councilor & Foreign Minister Wang Yi  at the High-level Video Conference On Poverty Eradication and South-South Cooperation  
As long as we keep united and forge ahead together, the day will come when all developing countries will shake off poverty.
China will always be a staunch member of the developing world; it will stand firm with all developing countries, and remain their reliable friend and true partner.
In this way, we will make new contribution to global poverty reduction and development.
China will fully deliver on the actions announced by President Xi Jinping at the 73rd #WorldHealthAssembly and the General Debate of the 75th session of the #UNGA.
The Chinese Academy of Sciences will release a report titled Big Earth Data in Support of Sustainable Development Goals (2020), which could be useful for countries that wish to better monitor and evaluate the implementation of #Agenda2030.  
China has recently put together a selection of poverty reduction cases in the form of a book titled Eradication of Poverty: China's Practices to share its experience with the world.  
Under the framework of South-South cooperation, China has provided over RMB 400 billion yuan of foreign assistance and built close to 3,000 complete projects.
China puts countries' shared interests first and always seeks to synergize its own development with the common development of all developing countries.
Thereby, we will meet the target of eradicating extreme poverty set out in #Agenda2030 ahead of schedule.
China will overcome the challenges brought by #COVID19, and lift all rural residents living below the current poverty line out of poverty within this year.
We must defend developing countries' legitimate rights and interests and development space, and further increase the representation and say of developing countries in international affairs.
We need to uphold the spirit of #solidarity and mutual assistance to empower the collective rise of developing countries through South-South cooperation.
The world should recommit resources to people's livelihood areas, and galvanize the necessary financial and technological support for developing countries. Using the master key of development, we could unlock the door toward no poverty.
Poverty confines human freedom and subdues development. It is the root cause of problems and conflicts in many countries and regions.
We need to support the #UN in galvanizing international efforts to build a new type of global development partnership that is more equal, more balanced, fairer and leaves no one behind.
Development is the foundation for peace and for human survival and dignity. The international community must take a "development first" approach, and place greater importance on the #2030Agenda.
We developing countries shall keep forging ahead as partners with common goals and aspirations. We need to focus on the #2030Agenda as a central priority.
On Sep 26, #China, #UNDESA and #UNDP jointly held the High-level Video Conference on Poverty Eradication and South-South Cooperation. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted and addressed the meeting.  
 
With the #CPC's leadership, 800 mln people in China have been lifted out of poverty, 70% of the world. While in the #US, the 5% of the world population accounts for 20% of #COVID19 cases worldwide.
China is on the side of humanity's shared interest, while the #US politicians only serve the ruling class and the interest groups behind. As #Stiglitz put it,  "of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%" .
We don't pursue "China first". We do pursue better lives for the Chinese people and people across the world. What will prevail in the end is #justice and common good.
Take a close look at this #CPC badge:  #为人民服务 --Serve the people.  This is the fundamental goal & mission of the CPC. It explains why China and the US acted so differently in response to #COVID19.  
200,000. This is not cold statistics but real lives. Without rights to survival, #HumanRights will only be illusion & nonsense.  
China is leading in #COVID19 vaccine R&D. 11 vaccines are in clinical trials, including 4 at Phase III. They will be made global public goods.  
Already fogotten? Last time the so-called "camp"was actually a "five-star" apartment complex. Better not fall twice in the same hole.  
Chinese young scientists have worked out the molecular structure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, revealing the "face" of the virus for the first time. The findings have been submitted to the EMDB and can be accessed  for free.  
#US frames that China disrespects ethnic minorities. Just look at China's #RMB banknotes, Tibetan, Uyghur, Mongolian and Sawcuengh are also printed beside mandarin. Ethnic solidarity is deeply rooted in Chinese society. Is there any other language than English on a USD banknote?  
According to this Trade and Development Report 2020 by #UNCATD, China's economy will remain in positive territory and its expected to grow at 1.3% this year.
How is #US in any position to blame China?  
 
Lies can in no way masquerade as truth.  
Robots dancing to welcome freshmen at a university in #Harbin. COOL!
 
Facts speak for everything.  
Every life is precious. The politicians need to put people first and do more to save people's lives instead of playing blameshift games.
At the podium of the #UN, the #US aims at #China while China looks to the world.
Statement by H.E. Xi Jinping President of the People's Republic of China At the General Debate of the 75th Session of The United Nations General Assembly:  
The baton of history has been passed to our generation, and we must make the right choice, a choice worthy of the people's trust and of our times.
✅China will set up a UN Global Geospatial Knowledge and Innovation Center and an International Research Center of Big Data for Sustainable Development Goals to facilitate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
✅China will provide US$50mln to the China-FAO South-South Cooperation Trust Fund (Phase III) ✅China will extend the Peace and Development Trust Fund between the UN and China by 5 years after it expires in 2025.
President Xi announced the following steps to be taken by China: ✅China will provide another US$50mln to the #UN #COVID19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan.
Rather, we aim to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. This will create more space for China's economic development and add impetus to global economic recovery & growth.
We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue & negotiation. We do not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in zero-sum game. We will not pursue development behind closed doors.
China is the largest developing country in the world, a country that is committed to peaceful, open, cooperative & common development. We will never seek hegemony, expansion, or sphere of influence. We have no intention to fight either a #ColdWar or a hot war with any country.
When in competition, countries should not breach the moral standard and should comply with international norms. Major countries should act like major countries. They should provide more global public goods, take up their due responsibilities and live up to people's expectations.
It is natural for countries to have differences. What's important is to address them through dialogue & consultation. Countries may engage in competition, but such competition should be positive & healthy in nature.
Global governance should be based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint cooperation&shared benefits so as to ensure all countries enjoy equal rights & opportunities and follow the same rules and embrace the underlying trend of peace, development & win-win cooperation.
#COVID19 is a major test of the governance capacity of countries; it is also a test of the global governance system. We should stay true to multilateralism and safeguard the intl system with the #UN at its core.
We call on all countries to pursue innovative, coordinated, green & open development for all, seize the historic opportunities presented by the scientific & technological revolution & industrial transformation, achieve a green recovery of the world economy in the post-COVID era.
The #ParisAgreement on climate change charts the course for the world to transition to green and low-carbon development. It outlines the minimum steps to be taken to protect the Earth, our shared homeland, and all countries must take decisive measures.
Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of Nature and go down the beaten path of extracting resources without investing in conservation, pursuing development at the expense of protection, and exploiting resources without restoration.
We should not dodge the challenges of economic globalization. Instead, we must face up to major issues such as the wealth gap and the development divide.
Burying one's head in the sand like an ostrich in the face of economic globalization or trying to fight it with Don Quixote's lance goes against the trend of history. The world will never return to isolation, and no one can sever the ties between countries.
The world is diverse in nature, and we should turn this diversity into a constant source of inspiration driving human advancement. This will ensure that human civilizations remain colorful and diversified.
We should see each other as members of the same big family, pursue win-win cooperation, and rise above ideological disputes and do not fall into the trap of "clash of civilizations". We should respect a country's independent choice of development path and model.
No country can gain from others' difficulties or maintain stability by taking advantage of others' troubles. To pursue a beggar-thy-neighbor policy or just watch from a safe distance when others are in danger will eventually land one in the same trouble faced by others.
China will honor its commitment of providing US$2 bln of intl assistance over 2 years, further intl cooperation in such fields as agriculture, poverty reduction, education, women&children, and climate change, and support other countries in restoring economic&social development.
Several #COVID19 vaccines developed by China are in Phase III clinical trials. When their development is completed and they are available for use, these vaccines will be made a global public good, and they will be provided to other developing countries on a priority basis.
We will continue to share our epidemic control practices and diagnostics & therapeutics, provide support & assistance to countries in need, ensure stable global anti-epidemic supply chains, and participate in the global research on tracing the virus' source & transmission routes.
We humans are battling #COVID19. People of different countries have come together, demonstrating courage, resolve and compassion. The virus will be defeated. Humanity will win this battle!
President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the General Debate of 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly
Germany's #DasErste aired a documentary on how Chinese farmers utilize live-streaming to sell products like duck eggs online. In times of #COVID19, technology has gifted farmers wings of prosperity. This is the digital future of agriculture.   
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister: This is just a deliberate distortion of our position. Latest example of #disinformation campaign by the #US.  
Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth: China in Action:  
China was the first to sign on the UN Charter and a founding member of the #UN75 . No matter how the world evolves, China's determination to support multilateralism will not change.  
China will continue to be a true follower of #multilateralism.
We must do some serious thinking: What kind of #UN is needed for the world? How should the UN play its role in the post-COVID era? ☑The UN must stand firm for justice ☑The UN must uphold the rule of law ☑The UN must promote cooperation ☑The UN must focus on real action
The sudden attack of #COVID19 is a grave test for the entire world. Mankind has entered a new era of interconnectedness, with countries sharing intertwined interests and their future closely linked together.
The #UN embodies the aspiration of the over 7 billion people for a better life, and the #UNCharter remains an important guarantee for world peace and development.
President Xi Jinping delivered a speech at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations.  
Secretary #Pompeo's announcement on "the return of UN sanctions on Iran" is illegitimate. The #US has quit the #JCPOA. It has no right to demand the #UNSC to invoke the #snapback mechanism. Again, the US is isolating itself like many times before.  
Check out what vocational education and training is really like in Xinjiang：  
 
Some US politicians won't fall asleep without smearing&attacking China everyday. But smearing&attacking won't help solve their problems. China stands for the interests of the humanity. We have to choose between to kneel or say NO to US diplomacy of sanction, coercion&intimidation
China has been committed to working with #ASEAN countries on agreeing on and abiding by the #COC to make sure the South China Sea is a sea of peace, stability, friendship and cooperation.
History should not be forgotten and we should look into the future. Away from hatred and #war, together for #peace and cooperation.
Full text:  
"I often ask myself before I fall asleep at night, how will future historians judge us 20 and 30 years from now? Will they say we've made the right choice that we've done our best for the relations for the two countries?" We should all have such vision & sense of responsibility.
As more people are taken ill and more lives lost to #COVID19, we must show political leadership, a sense of community and extraordinary solidarity between and within countries.  
Secretary #Pompeo and his allies have been talking about "allow" as if China could manipulate the virus. Ridiculous. If the virus could be ordered, then how to explain the 6.78 million cases and over 200,000 deaths in the #US? Is this what the #USgovernment "allows"?  
#Wuhan resumed international passenger flights after 8-month hiatus.    
People are truly upset by #US worldwide, systematic, indiscriminate cyberattacks and eavesdropping. This should be stopped, but the US "chose not to". As a responsible country, China defends internet security and proposed the Global Initiative on #DataSecurity. Why not join us?  
Pompeo said at a virtual conversation with Atlantic Council that more people internationally are recognizing China's selfishness and bid for global dominance, leading more countries to side with Washington's view of the world.  
The truth is just the opposite. Surveys show that the image of the #US has become increasingly unpopular as a result of misguided foreign policies led by Pompeo.
According to a recent survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations, Europeans' trust in the #US is gone and their perception of the US has drastically deteriorated during the #CoronavirusPandemic.
According to the Best Countries 2020 rankings, the world's trust in the #US has dropped by 50% over the past two years, the sharpest drop of any country assessed in the report.
A Gallup report shows that US leadership remains unpopular worldwide, and it fares worst in its traditional allies in Europe. A survey of 37 countries by the Pew Research Centre found that only 20% approved of the US' handling of international affairs.
Another Pew poll released yesterday shows that favorable view of the US in Britain, France, Germany, Japan and South Korea is as low as it has been at any point.  
According to the #ADB, China is one of the few economies in the Asia Pacific bucking economic downturn due to #COVID19. China saw growth recover from 6.8% contraction in Q1 to 3.2% growth in Q2.  
As President Xi stressed at a recent symposium with scientists and professionals, the scientific & technological development must benefit people's lives and health.   
China appreciates the objective and fair ruling of the #WTO. The multilateral trading system with the WTO at its center is the cornerstone of international trade.
Human rights are indeed fundamental to national  governance. It is exactly because the Chinese government and the CPC respect human rights and put people's life front and center that  we have been able to bring #COVID19 pandemic under control within such a short time.  
The media reports they cited mainly came from ASPI & Adrian Zenz, which have been revealed as fabricated lies & rumors. It's unprofessional & immoral to base foreign policies on malicious lies & to make unwarranted accusations against another country.
FM Payne & her American allies have been lashing out at China's #Xinjiang policy. But do they know the real situation in Xinjiang? Have they been there & seen with their own eyes everything they accuse China of?  
The #US again stands in opposition to the international community. Its objection to the UN resolution calling for solidarity and cooperation against #COVID19 only isolates itself.  Like many times before.  
世界最高齢のジャイアントパンダ「永明」は28歳の誕生日を迎えたばかり。人間で言うと80歳に相当するお爺ちゃんパンダです。北京生まれで、今は日本の和歌山県で15頭の赤ちゃんパンダを育てています。両国をつなぐパンダ大使、お誕生日おめでとう！  
The world's oldest panda #Eimei just celebrated his 28th birthday, equal to over 80 years old in human years. He was born in Beijing and has fathered 15 cubs in Japan. Panda ambassador, happy birthday!  
#Reuters reports, African Americans have always been more likely to be jobless. But in China, people of all ethnicities have the right to work and are protected by law. Can't believe some in the #US define voluntary employment and pursuit of a better life as forced labor.  
They also agreed to forge green and digital partnerships through the establishment of high-level dialogue on environment & climate change & digital cooperation.
The leaders announced the signing of the China-EU agreement on geographical indications, pledged to speed up #BIT negotiations in an effort to conclude it within this year.
The leaders planned for #ChinaEURelations going forward & specified key areas of win-win cooperation. They agreed to enhance communication & coordination, uphold multilateralism, jointly address global challenges & elevate bilateral ties to a higher level.
President Xi Jinping just held a meeting via videoconference with #German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Charles Michel of the #EuropeanCouncil & President Ursula von der Leyen of the #EuropeanCommission. The meeting was frank & fruitful.  
The Chamber noted, European businesses are confident about profitability in China and China's economy. They have no intention to move out.
Like a bull in a china shop, as President of the #EuropeanChamber described, some country acts in a way that hurts European economy and tries to corner China. But it seems not working.  
Seriously?! Fact check: The 12 people were arrested for illegally crossing the border in waters. They are not democratic activists, but elements attempting to separate #HongKong from China.  
China has put forward its eight-point #GlobalInitiative on #DataSecurity. We hope the US can make positive response and jointly ensure data security.  
No wonder the #US takes issue with China on #DataSecurity. Their accusations are based exactly on what they have been doing. The US side should stop channeling users' data to the government.  
The #NPC has never deliberated or made any legislation on US internal affairs. But the #USCongress keeps drafting all kinds of bills on China’s internal affairs. It should be China calling on the US to take back their overreached hands.
Some in the #US keeps accusing China of interfering in their internal affairs. The fact is just the opposite. China doesn't have the gene of meddling with the affairs of US and others.
No country should interfere in others' internal affairs or level groundless accusations at other countries' political system or development path.
Against the backdrop of #COVID19, certain countries have been spreading misinformation and disinformation. When it comes to information release, facts should be respected.
State Councilor & FM Wang Yi just reached an important consensus regarding combating disinformation with his Russian counterpart Lavrov. Both China and #Russia are deeply concerned and call on all governments and media outlets to strengthen coordination and reject disinformation.  
#COVID19 is a test for all countries regardless of political parties and social systems.  Take a look at the scores of China and the #US.  
Be silent! That's what the Chinese journalists were told after their homes were raided by the Australian intelligence agency on Jun 26. No reasonable explanation was offered yet.  The unwarranted search, interrogation and obstruction of normal reporting reveal its hypocrisy.
What the #US did is apparently irrelevant to freedom of the press. Clearly it is carefully choreographed to find fault with China. The proposed op-ed is just a decoy to trap China.
I wonder if the Chinese side sends a #US media an article filled with lies and malicious smears, demands reply by next day and asks for publishing without revision, can any US media possibly agree?
Curiously, on August 27, US Assistant Secretary #Stilwell for East Asian and Pacific Affairs lodged representations with the Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. and expressed concern.
The article is full of loopholes and seriously inconsistent with facts and wantonly attacks and smears China.
On August 26, the #US embassy in China contacted People's Daily with a proposed op-ed by Ambassador Branstad, stressing the importance that the article be printed in full and without any edits before September 4 and asking for a reply by the very next day, August 27.
As to the fallacy by #Pompeo, the spokesperson of People's Daily has already made a response to lay out the facts and truth.  
This year marks the 75th anniversary of the #UN. China just released its Position Paper in this regard.   
 
 
Some key numbers and achievements in China's battle against #COVID19.  
They deserve the honor as they have saved tens of thousands of lives.  Salute to the heroes.  
The most renowned respiratory disease expert Dr Zhong Nanshan was conferred the #MedalOfTheRepublic. Dr Zhang Boli, Zhang Dingyu, and Chen Wei were conferred the national honorary title "the People's Hero" for their contribution to the fight against #COVID19.  
 
Who on earth should be held accountable? What really matters is whether leaders & political parties put people & life first and pay due respect to science & facts.
While life is returning to normal in China, confirmed cases in US is around 6.29mil&total death 180k+. China managed to bring #COVID19 under control before 0.006% of the population got infected. In contrast, up to 2% of Americans have contracted the virus&it's still spreading.
The Chinese population is 4 times that of the #US, but the number of China's total confirmed #COVID19 cases is less than 1/2 of the US death toll. Five months ago when #Wuhan reopened on April 8, China had around 83k cases and the US reported roughly 396k.
Why are #US officials so fragile & afraid? Where's your confidence in your culture and values?
@SecPompeo & @statedept If learning Mandarin, #KungFu, Chinese calligraphy&dance at Confucius Institutes poses threats to the US, then how many years&how seriously has China been threatened by the US? As so many Chinese learn&speak English, watch Hollywood movies&drink Starbucks?  
We would be glad to continue our excellent cooperation with the #US journalists here if the Chinese journalists are treated fairly in the US.
#CNN journalist and a few other #US journalists' visa extension applications are being processed, during which they can continue to live and work here with no problems at all. We've made it very clear to your colleagues in Beijing.
@StateDept @statedeptspox: You should be honest to tell people since 2018 StateDept has delayed&denied visas of about 30 Chinese journalists&expelled 60 in Mar, limited visas for all Chinese journalists to a max 90-day stay in May&has not approved visa extension of any of them.
Could the DIRTY #US build a #CLEANnetwork?  
 
In #Wuhan, the Chinese city once hit hard by #COVID19, over one million students returned to schools. Another sign of life returning to normal.  
This is another proof that the #US diplomacy today has stooped to intimidation, lies and sanctions. The US is making itself a destroyer of multilateralism and terminator of international order.  
We hope the #US will stop measuring others by their own yardsticks. Unlike the US, China doesn't have the meme of interfering in others' domestic affairs, nor is it interested or willing to do so.
#US #AttorneyGeneral #WilliamBarr called China a greater threat than #Russia & #Iran in interfering in the upcoming US presidential election. This is another proof of the US "Lying Diplomacy".
The #UN is facing serious financial difficulties. As the largest debtor with long-standing arrears, the #US accounts for over 2/3 of the total unpaid assessments, which is the main reason for the UN's financial difficulties. The US should fulfill its intl responsibilities&duties.  
He also claimed that the #US bent a knee to China over the past four decades. I wonder why #Pompeo has portrayed the US as so subservient to China? That's definitely not the case.
#Pompeo said China is ripping off the #US and destroying American jobs. Does anyone believe the US can ever allow another country to exploit it for decades? The answer is of course NO.
#WHO is an international body composed of 194 sovereign states. It cannot serve only one country. Any attempt to oppress or even blackmail WHO is a disregard for human life.  
Dr. Zhong Nanshan was named to the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response. We believe he will contribute to the panel's work with professionalism and expertise.
#COVID19 may have prevented us from meeting face to face, but it can't block the growth of trade in services. Nor will it affect our confidence and action as we pursue shared progress. Let us pull together to get over this difficult period and move to embrace a better tomorrow.
China will support #Beijing in setting up a pilot #FTZ for technological innovation, opening-up of the services sector and digital economy. It will serve opening-up for the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and reform and opening-up at a higher level.
It shows China's willingness to work with other countries to enable global trade in services to thrive and the world economy to recover at an early date. We also hope people across the world can enjoy breakthroughs in services trade and share in the benefits of social progress.
President Xi addressed the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 #ChinaInternationalFairforTradeinServices on September 4.  
 
 
 
 
 
It has nothing to do with #NationalSecurity or compensation. It is coercion and outright robbery!  
What kind of "world"❓ World=#US❓ The sky in the eyes of a frog in the well?  
Facts speak louder than words. China's development has won herself a "vote of confidence":  
Instead of talking about the trustworthiness of other countries, #Pompeo should first make concrete efforts to earn the trust from the American people.
The US diplomacy today has stooped to intimidation, lies and sanctions. It's arrogant and preposterous for a country with a history of less than 250 years to believe that it can change a major country with a political civilization of more than 4,000 years.  
Openness, inclusiveness and diversity are what the #US was founded on. However, the US today is entirely different. It is filled with isolation, hatred and xenophobia. Openness brings progress, while self-seclusion leaves one behind. This is a harsh lesson from history.
Some forces have been stigmatizing, demonizing and even oppressing Chinese students in the #US on trumped-up charges. Under such circumstances, I wonder how many Chinese parents can see their children studying in the US without worrying?
Chinese students and scholars have contributed greatly to science & technology innovation in the #US. Chinese students account for 1/3 of all foreign students in the US, contributing over $15 billion to the country every year.
Since China and the #US established diplomatic ties 41 years ago, #PeopletoPeopleExchange has played an important role in enhancing mutual understanding and advancing steady development of bilateral relations.
As an Australian proverb goes, "Keep your eyes on the sun and you will not see the shadows." We hope the Australian side will keep their eyes on the bright future of the China-Australia relations and adopt a constructive rather than destructive China policy.
Over 12,000 Australian companies have set up branches in China. Over 1.4 million Chinese tourists visit Australia every year. China has been Australia's biggest #TradingPartner for 11 years in a row.
ABC News reported that two members of the National #FoundationforAustraliaChinaRelations have been funded by the US Department of State. Last year, the trade volume between China&Australia reached 235 bil. Australian dollars&nearly 230,000 Chinese students studied in Australia.
If #Australia is serious about investigating foreign interference, there are many clues. Australian media have revealed that #ASPI has long been receiving funds from the #US government and arms dealers.
The President of the #Czech Senate took a China Airlines flight to one of China's provinces to sabotage China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. IRONIC! He needs a lesson on the history of the Chinese nation.
 
The American people also deserve better equality and better life. Listen to the cries of your people and save more time for improving their lives pls.
The Chinese people of course deserve a better life. That's what the people-centered CPC has been serving to do. And this is exactly the biggest difference between #CPC and your party.
For this reason, I want to thank #Pompeo, because everytime you opened your mouth, the Chinese people loved their country and the #CPC even more deeply.
It's true the evil behavior of the top #US diplomat has changed the perception of the people around the world and overturned the image of the US as the "lighthouse".
Now as China is embarking on a path of green & sustainable development and moving to the higher end of the supply chain, the #US becomes so hysterical to attack and rob us openly.
For years the #US has benefited immensely from the low-price & high-quality products China has supplied at the cost of sacrificing its own environment.
Facts speak louder than smears. Whatever some people might say, we will keep doing the right things. China, keep alert and stay strong!  
We appreciate PM Shinzo Abe's efforts to improve China-Japan relations. We wish him a speedy recovery and good health. 日中関係の改善にご尽力された安倍晋三総理に一同ご敬意を表します。一日も早くご快復を心よりお祈り申し上げます。
Heading to Mars: China's #Mars probe #Tianwen-1 has traveled around 100 mil. km as of 10:08 a.m. Friday, according to the China National Space Administration (CNSA). The Mars probe is in stable condition & its multiple payloads have finished self-checks. Expecting more good news!  
It has been too long that some #US politicians put self political interests above the people and above international laws. The US, once a "lighthouse of democracy", has now become the biggest threat to real democracy, ruIe of law and world peace.  
By hysterically suppressing China in an all-round way, today's #US is heading down a path of self-deception and self-isolation.
The message from #Washington seems to be very clear: as long as the #CPC insists on the uniqueness of its development path, everything comes out of China would automatically be branded as a "threat", if not "evil".  
Latest survey results of the #AmericanChamber (AmCham) in #Shanghai:  
The #US' arm is sooooooooo long that it extends far and beyond to snare foreign companies carrying out normal activities on their own territory! Its octopus-like long arms should first snatch its fighter jets and warships out of other country's doorstep!  
Fact check: Peter Navarro's lies about China on #COVID19 pandemic   
#Navarro has many sins. The Biggest sin is LYING. With over 180,000 American lives lost, Navarro and his like are still doing everything they can to blame and attack China, while doing nothing to save lives. These are truly deadly unforgivable sins. What a shame!
George Floyd. Jacob Blake. …… Who will be the next? and how many more?  
A nice meeting with Cuban Ambassador to China H.E. Carlos Miguel Pereira @cmphcuba. China-Cuba friendship has been consolidated with the passing of time, and will always go on.
Only one explanation: bullying China and denying China's right to development. We support the relevant company in taking legal actions to defend their legitimate rights and interests.
Why are some US politicians so afraid of #TikTok?Why are they denying ordinary American people the platform for entertainment, inspiration and connection?  
Congratulations to Ambassador Duan Jielong, on his election as a member of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea!
It is unfortunate that some US politicians are suffering from "anti-China syndrome". They reflexively strike at everything that has anything to do with China and crack down on China unconditionally out of fear of China's development.
Gone are the days where the #US is esteemed as "shining city upon a hill". According to a 2018 #Pewsurvey, 45% of respondents across 23 countries consider US a major threat to world peace, and that percentage reached nearly 70% in some of its own allies.  
Russia and China are strengthening strategic high tech partnership on #5G.   
These are signals of China's steady economic recovery, which have spurred confidence for the world and will propel the global economic recovery!
Statistics show that China's domestic flights have recovered to around 90% level of the same period last year. Number of bookings for some popular routes even exceed that of the same period last year.
By choosing to strengthen economic and trade cooperation with China, the #US business community has made the right and wise decision because their choice brings them opportunities and future.
The American Chamber of Commerce in China has secured approval to fly #US executives back to China. Almost 200 people had signed up for a San Francisco to Beijing charter flight since Monday - well over the 120 needed to make it happen.
Dr Zhong Nanshan shared China's experience and practices against #COVID19 through a webinar with representatives of foreign missions in China. Together we will fight the virus.  
Have you ever seen any "brutal repression" like this? It is true that China's ethnic minorities live a much happier and freer life than African Americans in the #US. Why not come to China to see with your own eyes? Of course after the pandemic is over.
#US Department of State has become a Department of Disinformation. It has been fabricating rumors to discredit other countries, which will only result in eroding its own reputation and credibility. The Uighur population in #Xinjiang has doubled over the past 40 years.  
This senior musician, who was in the picture of the touching moment, is now fully recovered. He dedicates the piece in gratitude to medical professionals who helped him in #Wuhan through #COVID19.  
#Pompeo only serves the rich instead of the majority. I hope he could show more care about his own PEOPLE. Save them from the pandemic and let them breathe freely!
In the #US, the salaries of CEOs are on average 400 times that of their mid-management employees. 1% control $30 trillion of assets. The 3 richest have more money than the poor 160 million. The wealth of black households is 1/10 that of whites.
Can lying #Pompeo represent the American people? Of course NOT.  
Snapshots of Wuhan, last weekend. The city only emerges stronger.
 
 
Some in the #US have been seeking by all means to sabotage #ChinaUSrelations&deliberately disrupting China's development. But we believe dialogue rather than confrontation is what the two peoples want. The future of China will be determined by the Chinese people, not anyone else.
 
The entire staff of the Chinese Consulate General in #Houston just arrived in #Beijing on a charter flight. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is welcoming them home at the airport.  
The #US expelled Chinese journalists working at the #UN. WHY?
As the top US diplomat, #Pompeo should know the CPC has around 92 million members with nearly 20 million applying to join. The strong bond between the CPC & the Chinese people is inseparable.
#Pompeo has been sparing no efforts to pit the Chinese people against the CPC. But even according to US survey results, Chinese people's support & satisfaction towards the CPC & Chinese Government exceeds 93%.
China's #Fauci Dr. Zhong Nanshan was awarded Medal of the Republic for his outstanding contributions to China's fight against #COVID19. He was the first to warn of human-to-human transmission. We are so sad to learn Dr. Fauci got harassment, even death threats.  
According to an article by The Intercept, the so-called "Clean Network", "as a policy document it's nonsensical, but as a moral document, a piece of codified hypocrisy, it's crystal clear: If there's going to be a world-spanning surveillance state, it better be made in the USA".  
91% indicate their China operations are profitable nearly 70% are optimistic about the commercial prospects of the Chinese market Meanwhile 86% report that tensions in bilateral relations have impacted their business
According to #USCBC 2020 Member Survey covering more than 100 companies, 83% counted China as either the top or among the top five priorities for their company’s global strategy.
During the past 3 days, over 150,000 were infected & 2,000 lives lost in the US, making the total infected over 5 million & deaths 160,000. For some US officials, political gain always comes before lives. We sincerely wish them success in bringing the pandemic under control ASAP.
Azar said in #Taiwan that if the virus had emerged in the #US, it might have been snuffed out easily. Really?!
The proposed #NationalSecurity & Personal Data Protection Act requires #US companies to transfer data home for local storage. So, the US qualified to build the so-called "Clean Network"?
The #EU doesn't put the #US on its whitelist for cross-border data transfer. EU Court of Justice recently invalidated #EUUSPrivacyShield as US govt could collect European citizens' personal data under US surveillance programs.
We must shoulder the historic responsibility, take a forward-looking attitude, assume a long-term perspective, take emotions out of the equation, and return to reason and pragmatism.
When handling the #ChinaUSRelationship, one should not only focus on what is at hand, or allow a tiny minority of anti-China elements to set the tone or lead it astray.
On issues concerning China's core interests & national dignity, there's no room for us to back down. We'll not move to the beat of villains, and we'll not put up with their wickedness either. We never fire the first shot. Every response is a move of self-defense & counterattack.
The moves are utterly disgraceful. The whole #US govt is ganging up like tigers preying on a rabbit. Also with fabricated allegations, it's hunting down #Huawei around the world. It pursues a digital gunboat policy, a clean network & turns the Internet into a self-serving US-net.
Without producing any solid evidence, the #US administration is taking actions against #TikTok based on the presumption of guilt, and threatening to force a sellout within 45 days or simply ban it. The "deal" is sheer gangster logic and daylight robbery.
The witch-hunt among Chinese scientists and harassment&detainment of Chinese students in the US are reminiscent of McCarthyism. Acting on the basis of race&ideology and hyping up the "red menace", the US politicians try to define China-US relations with ideological confrontation.
In the 1950s anti-communist hysteria, the Chinese community in the #US was suspected as "spies". Over 20 mln people had to go through "screening". Even kids had to sign a "loyalty oath". "Find reds under the beds" describes such insane paranoia.
The string of recent actions taken by the #US against China are aimed at stoking ideological confrontation and reviving the #ColdWar in the 21st century. It feels like that the specter of #McCarthyism is resurfacing in the US.
The #US interferes in others' internal affairs and is the world champion in quitting intl orgs and treaties. Its so-called "rules" is nothing but power politics and privileges to do whatever it wants. The US "blunt and amoral" foreign policy "cannot work over the long haul".
Some #US politicians lie readily, and they break the law habitually. They smear China without any shame and preach intl law to others but put itself above the intl law with "American Exceptionalism".
Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng's had an exclusive interview with  
124 Chinese companies (including #HK-based) are on the #Fortune Global 500 list in 2020. The number was 4 in 1997. This has been won by hard work, openness & innovation of the Chinese people.  
The #US Clean Network Program will turn Internet into "Splinternet". The Internet Society statement rejects the US policy and people will say no to it.  
Listen to the voice of the people.  
No one could change rotation of the Earth. It's only imagination that the #US can forever stay in the light & China in the dark.
@statedeptspox Obviously it is not China that preferred saving face over saving lives. For the #US, anything that doesn't help cover up its lies is either disinformation or propaganda & couldn't possibly be facts. But truth will out.  
 
A State Dept cable sent in January 2018 on #US embassy officials' visit to #Wuhan Institute of Virology was used as evidence that the virus came from Wuhan. But the fact is the visit took place 2 months later without tour of labs or discussion about biosafety procedures.
 
Thanks Maria, for speaking out for truth and justice. #US political intervention & discrimination against #TikTok is another evidence that fair competition & market principles are nothing but empty slogans for the US.  
 
Respect history, look to the future and  firmly safeguard and stabilize China-US relations.  
According to #WHO, 165 vaccine candidates are in some forms of trials, with 26 in clinical trials. Six #COVID19 vaccine candidates, including three from China, have entered phase-3 trials.
Talking CLEAN while doing DIRTY. How ironic!
China's daily #COVID19 nucleic acid testing capacity has hit 4.84 million & 160 million tests have already been done nationwide. We are developing more fast testing products & leading vaccine R&D. China is ready for closer anti-epidemic cooperation with the world.
Clearly, these have nothing to do with #freedomofnavigation/flight, but sheer military provocation, pressure and coercion.
#SCSPI revealed the sharp increase of #US military reconnaissance aircraft in frequency and intensity on the doorstep of China, sometimes less than 100 kilometers from the Guangdong coastline.  
#ABC and #APACNews revealed 2 people deeply hostile against China with the National Foundation for Australia-China Relations are funded by the #USStateDepartment. Wonder if the Australian government would invoke anti-foreign interference laws to investigate.  
The 3rd #CIIE has attracted more companies, and the average exhibition area for the #Fortune500 and other leading companies will be 14% larger than last year. These facts speak to the world's confidence in China's development prospect.  
A recent survey by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce shows 99.1% of foreign companies in China will continue to invest and operate in China.
What the #US is doing with #TikTok reminds one of France's #Alstom in The American Trap and Japan's #TOSHIBA in the 1980s. For the US, national security is  just another name for hegemony.  
The fundamental political position of Marxist parties is putting people first.  
Today is #InternationalDayofFriendship. At this difficult time, we need friendship, solidarity and cooperation, instead of hatred, discrimination and confrontation.  
The outburst of this 75-year-old veteran is thought provoking. He deserves to be treated better than pepper spray.  
Lies, however, will always be lies. The different versions of the story concocted by the US side have no factual base and mix black with white.
The #US has been fabricating pretexts and spreading lies about its decision to demand China to close its Consulate-General in #Houston and has churned out different versions of the story.   
 
Our Mars probe Tianwen-1 sent back what it saw 1.2ml km away: The Earth and the Moon are looking at each other in the vast space.  
These #US media reports make it clear that #Pompeo does not represent the American people. Pompeo and the current US foreign policy does not serve the American people's interests.  
 
#US has been threatening others not to do business with #Huawei for national security reasons. After failing to provide any evidence, they now turn to human rights. The biggest HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSER is using human rights as an excuse to repress a Chinese company. How ironic!  
At 10 am July 27, as required by the Chinese side, the #US Consulate General in Chengdu was closed. China's competent authorities then entered through the front entrance and took over the premises.  
 
An updated #Edelman report shows 95% of the Chinese people trust their government, the highest rate in the world.  
 
"The #US, in the last decades, has launched major #wars, bringing disasters not only to certain countries but to the entire regions. It also disrupted the intl order by unilateral sanctions outside the agreed #UN framework." #JohnRoss at the #NototheNewColdWar convention.  
The premises of China's Consulate General in #Houston are the Chinese government's property. The US' break-in is in violation of the #ViennaConventiononConsularRelations as well as the #USConstitution and the #ForeignMissionsAct. It is no different from burglary.  
"Houston, we've had a problem here."  
#Disinformation is a common enemy to the international community. Countries should strengthen solidarity & coordination, combat disinformation, reject double standards & interference in others' #internalaffairs, & oppose slanders on others' #politicalsystems & #developmentpaths.
Just had video consultations with Russian MFA spokesperson Maria #Zakharova. We condemn the act of spreading #disinformation out of ideological bias, which has poisoned the atmosphere of global opinion.
This is a legitimate & necessary response to the unilateral provocative move by the US to demand the closure of China's Consulate General in Houston.
China just informed the #US side of its decision to withdraw its consent for the establishment & operation of US Consulate General in Chengdu. The US Consulate General in Chengdu must cease all operations & events as required.  
蓬佩奥在尼克松总统图书馆的讲话表明他想把自己塑造成21世纪的杜勒斯，在一个全球化的世界对华搞新的十字军东征。他的所作所为形象地展现了什么叫“蚍蜉撼树“。现在是到了全世界所有爱好和平的人站出来阻止他给世界造成更大危害的时候了。
It's about time that all peace-loving people around the world stepped forward to prevent him from doing the world more harm.
#Pompeo's speech at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library suggests that he wants to present himself as the John Foster Dulles of the 21st century, launching a new crusade against China in a globalized world. What he is doing is as futile as an ant trying to shake a tree.
Wonder why #Pompeo hates the CPC so much? Is it because CPC poses real threats to the world? Let's have a look at the facts.  
China successfully launched its first #Mars probe Tianwen-1, the 1st step in its planetary exploration of the solar system. A step in scientific research, and a stride for the common good of the humanity with a shared future.  
The #US should revoke its erroneous decision. China will surely react with firm #countermeasures.
#Infiltration & #interference is never in the genes & tradition of China's #ForeignPolicy. While Chinese diplomats are promoting mutual understanding & friendship, the #US embassy in China publicly attacks China's political system.
As a result of smears & hatred fanned up by the #US gov, the Chinese embassy has received #bomb & #DeathThreats.
This is an unprecedented upgrade of #US #PoliticalOppression against China following imposing restrictions on Chinese diplomats & opening Chinese diplomatic pouches.
The #US demanded the closure of Chinese Consulate General in #Houston in 3 days. The reason is to protect "American intellectual property & private information". Unbelievably ridiculous!  
Why so much hostility & hatred toward China? What is the real fear? For the sake of the American people's life and future, stop playing the blame-shifting game.
Dozens of cases show there has been systemic & targeted #harassment & #oppression towards Chinese students, scholars & scientists in the #US, with coercive interrogation, random seizure of electronic devices & even wanton detainment. INDEED #McCarthyism is back in the US.
In 2019, over 200 million people from home & abroad visited #Xinjiang & over 40 million to #Tibet. Like other provinces in China, Xinjiang & Tibet are free, open & friendly to all tourists including foreign friends, except those with hidden agenda.  
So glad to have my colleague Wang Wenbin to join me at this podium.  
The #US politicizes #COVID19 response at home and uses "attacking China" as a panacea for domestic problems. A real-life #HouseofCards is on in #Washington, with people's lives at stake.
#China's #GDP grew by 3.2% year-on-year in Q2, showing strong resilience & great potential. We'll step up cooperation with other countries on epidemic prevention and resumption of work & production to contribute to #GlobalEconomicRecovery.  
China stealing #US vaccine research? China is leading in #COVID19 vaccine R&D. No need & no where to steal. We've built the world's largest production facility & are working with other countries on #vaccine R&D.
Secretary #Pompeo claims moral superiority of the #US over China, saying the US secures more freedom for its citizens. Is that so? Like the emperor in his "new clothes" lost in a world by himself. Please give Floyd & other African Americans the freedom to breathe first.
After PRISM & Equation Group, the latest revelation by #Yahoo News exposed "secret authorization" for #CIA to conduct #cyberattacks. The #US is the biggest threat to peace & security in global cyber space.
The #US has been proud of its democracy, freedoms & values, but it won't allow a foreign private company to do its business. Huawei's only fault is it's Chinese. The US repression of Huawei is not "clean" but dirty.
The #US is pressing the accelerator to trash China-US relations, while China is putting the brakes on. The US should know that its enemy is the virus, not China.
In the last 38 years, the #US has withdrawn from 18 international organizations and treaties. Shouldn't it rejoin them before making groundless criticism against China?  
The #US pursuit of giant leaps in #nuclear weaponry endangers global strategic stability & poses greater security risks. It should contribute to global strategic stability with concrete deeds.  
If only strength talks, then it's no different from the law of the jungle. Without goodwill, the greater the strength, the greater the menace. The tree hopes for peace, but the wind keeps blowing. If the #US wants to make waves, then let the storm rage on!
Despite the pandemic, #ChinaEuropefreighttrain services in the first half of 2020 grew by 36% to 5,122 trips, transporting 27,000 tonnes & 3.67 million pieces of medical supplies. It has become a key cargo lifeline & bond of solidarity in the global fight against #COVID19.  
Will the #UK maintain its independence or become a cat's paw for the #US? It is the responsibility of the British government to make a decision that best serves its people's interests.
Cooperation with #Huawei in the past 20 years serves #UK interests. Banning Huawei will hurt its interests. It's a big world. The UK ban won't stop Huawei from growing stronger.
Banning #Huawei is not about #nationalsecurity, but political manipulation & oppression. Trump admits to talking many countries out of using Huawei. It shows again that it's the #US, not China, that has been intimidating, threatening and coercing others.
We will assess this development in a comprehensive & serious manner and take all necessary measures to protect the legitimate interests of Chinese enterprises.
It's not about a company or sector, but about the #UK politicizing commercial & tech issues, about Chinese investment facing greater threats, about whether one still takes the UK market as open, fair & non-discriminatory.
The #UK followed the #US in discriminating against & excluding #Huawei on the ground of alleged risks without any evidence. It violated market principle & free trade rules, broke its own commitment and undermined China-UK mutual trust.
The #US made up the lie of the century on #Xinjiang. As exposed by independent US news website, the rumor of "a million Uyghurs detained" was spread by NED-funded anti-China organization & Adrian Zenz, senior fellow with research group set up by US intelligence.
In stark contrast, the #US puts selfish political gains and capital first. As a result, its #COVID19 death toll is still rising. The loss of precious lives is just heartbreaking!
CPC represents the vast majority's interests&serves people heart and soul. That's why it enjoys over 90% satisfaction rate. That's why China has been the only big country to become the second largest economy without resorting to warfare, colonialism or slavery in recent decades.
O'Brien claims that under #CPC's Marxism-Leninism, individuals do not possess inherent value & people are merely a tool. He should really read up on Marxist-Leninist works. Putting people first is the fundamental political position of Marxist parties.
10. Consultations on the #COC are accelerating & advancing in an orderly manner. The 2nd reading of the draft negotiating text has been launched. China & @ASEAN members have agreed to conclude the COC at an early date. No outside interference can sabotage such efforts.
9. The #US has not ratified the #UNCLOS but keeps accusing China of violating the UNCLOS. That's hypocritical.
8. The US,tens of thousands of miles away from the #SouthChinaSea,sent advanced military airplanes to the region to flex its military muscles,which caused instability in the South China Sea. China, as an independent sovereign state,has the right to refuse bullying and injustice.
7. It is the #US, not China that takes a predatory world view. China upholds the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind and a neighborhood diplomacy of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness.
6. It is the #US, not China, that believes in "might makes right" & resorts to force & intimidation at every turn. It is the US that has waged color revolutions & illegal wars, displacing millions in Iraq, Libya & Afghanistan. China has never started any war.
5. None of the working oil drilling rigs in #disputedwaters in the #SouthChinaSea are China's.
4. China is committed to upholding the #freedomofnavigation and overflight in and above the #SouthChinaSea enjoyed by all states under #internationallaw. Such freedom has never encountered any problem and we have never heard about any country complaining about that.
3. Over 70 years ago, China lawfully recovered the #Nansha & #Xisha Islands illegally occupied by Japan and resumed exercise of sovereignty. As a matter of fact, the military vessels China used in recovering the islands were provided by the #US.
2. The Chinese people's activities in the #SouthChinaSea date back to over 2,000 years ago. China's sovereignty and relevant rights and interests in the South China Sea have been established in the long course of history, solidly grounded in history & law.
1. #NineDashedLine was not announced by China in 2009. The first official #SouthChinaSea map with interrupted lines was published in 1948 by the Chinese government and handed down by successive governments with no others raising disputes.
#Pompeo's statement on #SouthChinaSea is another proof of #US attempts to sow discord between China and other littoral countries. Some basic facts need to be cleared up:
Is it Navarro or #RonVara who's claiming that #TikTok data goes right to Chinese military&the CPC? Any evidence? No? Just a new entry on his list of shameless lies. The #US boasts of its strong values, yet it fears a fun app popular with youngsters. When did it become so fragile?
How about #Washington? Mr Secretary, show us honesty and courage to listen to your people and face up to the reality.  
It's absurd and evil for LYING #Pompeo (proud of lying, cheating and stealing) to talk about credibility. The #CPC enjoys the highest rate of support and satisfaction among the Chinese people, as over 90% according to international surveys and the latest by Harvard University.
Please think and act independently with sense and brains. Acting as a volunteered cat's paw is not in the interests of Australian people.
Australian official admitted that they want to attract more Hong Kong talents to generate more wealth&jobs. But given increasing racial discrimination against Chinese&Asians and abuse of "Foreign Interference Act", shouldn't people be concerned about their safety in Australia?
Some in the US have been unscrupulously encircling and smearing China, attempting to kneel on and choke China. But truth and justice will prevail anyway!
The US should take actual measures to address its own problems before lecturing and interfering in others' internal affairs in the name of human rights. It only makes the US look so pale and hypocritical.
The US allegation on Xinjiang is among the Biggest Lies of the Century. Uyghurs' population in Xinjiang grew from 5.5 million to 11.7 million over 40 years. Unlike African Americans, they enjoy free breathing!  
Such a low lie and clumsy frame-up! What a pity that Cheating, Lying, Scapegoating and Sanction have now become the name cards of Washington.  
The two sides should manage them well in the spirit of seeking common ground while putting aside differences, so as to minimize their impact on and harm to the overall China-US relations.
The third is a list of issues that need proper management. It should identify the few tough issues that the two countries have little chance to agree on in the near future.
The second is a list of dialogues. It should itemize the issues of differences that could be solved through dialogues. They should be designated to the existing dialogue mechanisms and platforms as soon as possible.
The first is a list of cooperation areas. It should specify all areas, bilateral and global, where China and the US need to and can work together. The longer this list goes, the better. Cooperation on this list should be immune to the impact of other issues.
It is useful for China and the #US to draw up the following three lists:
The US, for its part, should immediately stop its acts of politicization and stigmatization and work with China to promote a global response to save more lives.
China is ready to share with the US information about #COVID19 prevention and containment as well as our response experience. And we are also ready to have closer exchanges with the US on diagnostics and therapeutics, vaccines, and economic recovery.
Nothing is more precious than human lives. Nothing is more pressing than saving lives. We have deep sympathies for the American people for their unfortunate experiences, and have provided the US an enormous amount of badly-needed medical supplies.
If the US lacks confidence, openness and inclusiveness to such an extent, and chooses to conjure up "China Threats" of various kinds, its paranoia may turn into self-fulfilling prophecies at the end of the day.
It seems as if every Chinese investment is politically driven, every Chinese student is a spy, and every cooperation initiative is a scheme with hidden agenda.
The current China policy of the US is based on ill-informed strategic miscalculation, and is fraught with emotions and whims and McCarthyist bigotry. Its suspicion about China, totally uncalled-for, has reached a point of paranoia.
These are the advice we must heed. More important, they are also the goals we must work for.
Many US universities have openly expressed their support for closer China-US educational exchanges. And many global leaders have called on China and the US to increase dialogue and cooperation and avoid confrontation and decoupling.
74 percent of US businesses in China said they plan to make more investment here. 191 agricultural organizations sent a joint letter to President Trump, calling for continued implementation of the phase one trade agreement.
Some say that China-US relations will not be able to return to its past. But that should not mean ignoring the history altogether and starting all over again, let alone impractical decoupling. It should mean building on past achievements and keeping pace with the times.
In the past 40 years and more since the establishment of diplomatic relations, the interests of China and the US have become highly integrated. China and the US have jointly accomplished many great things to the benefit of not only the two countries but also the world.
China and the US were allies who fought side by side during WWII. In the 1970s, the two sides reopened the door toward establishing diplomatic ties on the basis of respecting the different systems of each other.
China has every right to uphold its sovereignty, security and development interests, safeguard the achievements that the Chinese people have made through hard work, and reject any bullying and injustice imposed on it.
While the US unscrupulously encircles and smears China around the world, and meddles in China’s domestic affairs, it should not demand unrealistically that China show understanding and support to the US in bilateral and global affairs.
China has maintained a highly stable and consistent policy toward the US. China and the US must work in the same direction, respect international law and international rules, and engage in equal dialogue and consultation.
China never intends to challenge or replace the US, or have full confrontation with the US. What we care most about is to improve the livelihood of our people. And what we hope for most is to maintain peace and stability of the world.
China and the US, despite their different social systems, have much to offer each other and could well co-exist peacefully.
China has learned a lot of useful experience from developed countries. Likewise, some of China's successful experiences have also been quite relevant for some countries in tackling their current challenges.
The American people have long pursued equality, inclusiveness and diversity. The world should not be viewed in binary thinking, and differences in systems should not lead to a zero-sum game. China will not, and cannot, be another US.
China does not replicate any model of other countries, nor does it export its own to others.
One particular view has been floating around in recent years, alleging that the success of China's path will be a blow and threat to the Western system and path. This claim is inconsistent with facts, and we do not agree with it.
After all, it should be the people of the country concerned to adjudicate whether their country's choice of system and path is right or not.
Every country takes its development path on the basis of its cultural and historic traditions. China's path has been the way out of poverty and backwardness for the 1.4 billion Chinese people. No one has the right to rebuff.
Hope the US will develop more objective and cool-headed perceptions about China, and a more rational and pragmatic China Policy.
Will the giant ship of China-US relations be able to stay on the right course in the future after more than four decades of voyage? The question matters to the future of the world and humanity.
Some in the #US with ideological biases are resorting to all possible means to portray China as an adversary, and even an enemy. They seek relentlessly to frustrate and contain China's development, and to impede interactions between China and the US.
China-US relations, one of the most consequential bilateral relationships in the world, is faced with the most severe challenge since the establishment of diplomatic ties.
State Councilor & Foreign Minister Wang Yi addressed at China-U.S. Think Tanks and Media Online Forum: Mutual Respect, Mutual Trust and Cooperation - The Right Way Forward for China-U.S. Relations.  
#Pompeo is a faithful follower/practitioner of the #GOP campaign strategy of attacking China. He is vilifying and slandering China for a living.
The world No.1 hacking state spares no efforts in accusing China of cyber theft, even saying that fun social-networking apps popular with youngsters have been weaponized. How come the only superpower in the world is so emotionally fragile and lacks self-confidence?
China and Russia will continue to firmly support each other and deepen strategic communication and coordination to maintain global strategic stability and security.
Russia firmly supports China's efforts to safeguard national security in #HKSAR and believes that China is fully capable of maintaining long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
President Xi Jinping spoke with President Vladimir Putin over the phone today. We congratulate Russia on the approval of constitutional amendments with an overwhelming majority in a smooth nationwide vote.
 
Just as Michael Ryan, @WHO emergencies director said, "People need to wake up. The data is not lying. The situation on the ground is not lying. " Indeed, there are many ways to deal with the pandemic. But stigmatizing others&blame shifting are by no means effective prescriptions.  
The Arab states expressed support to China's efforts to safeguard #nationalsecurity in #HK under the framework of "One Country, Two Systems". We will also continue to support each other in the fight against #COVID19.
The 9th Ministerial Meeting of China-Arab States Cooperation Forum was just held via videolink. We wiⅠl join hands to build a community with a shared future for China and Arab states.  
These are exactly what we want to know & are trying to find out. Hope the #US will invite the @WHO for an early & thorough investigation.  
Together, we shall overcome.  
Even a small discrepancy will lead to a great error. Malicious lies will, still worse, result in huge misconception and misunderstanding. Falsehoods find no market among the fair-minded.  
@ASPI_org has cooked up many false reports on China. It is an anti-China lobby, generously funded by Australian and #US governments and multi-billion-dollar weapon makers. Isn't it a disinformation campaign against China?!  
At the #UNHRC,Cuba spoke on behalf of 53 countries, Belarus spoke on behalf of 46 countries, and 21 countries spoke separately in support of China. We thank them for upholding justice.
The biggest difference between China and the #US is that China puts people first, while the US puts money and politics first. China sees problems and keeps reforming and improving, while the US politicians turn blind to their problems and always play the blame game.
LYING #Pompeo made great success in making the US famous for LYING. But LYING couldn't save lives nor help African Americans breathe.
27 western countries cannot represent the whole international community. China is supported at the #UNHRC by countries DOUBLE that number. It is clear whose side the international community is on.
"#OneCountryTwoSystems" is the creation & heritage of Mr. Deng Xiaoping. The law will ensure its full & faithful implementation and long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. This is China living up to its international obligations and responsibilities.
The British government and parliament are responsible for #nationalsecurity in Scotland. Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. The Chinese Central Government absolutely has the responsibility for national security in the #HKSAR.
They are just worried about losing the right and freedom to use HK as a base and tool to hurt China's national security!
Why is the #US so mad and crazy about China enacting the law on safeguarding #nationalsecurity in #HK? Is it true that they really care about HK residents' rights and freedoms? Of course NOT!
The UK should know it has no sovereignty, jurisdiction, or right of "supervision" over HK after 1997. The UK should face the new reality instead of dreaming old days.
The #UK will honor its commitments? During the 156 years under British colonial rule, did #HK residents ever enjoy any democracy or freedom? Was any of the former HK governors elected by the HK residents?
Then why should't China make the law to safeguard its #nationalsecurity? In particular given the real threat from “Hong Kong independence” forces, radical localists and external forces.
Basic policies regarding #HK in the Sino-British Joint Declaration were proposed by China on its own and are fully incorporated in the #BasicLaw formulated by the NPC. In 156 years of British colonial rule, the #BritishTreasonAct and its enforcement agency were introduced in HK.
Constitutions of 100+ countries stipulate that exercising basic rights&freedoms shall not endanger #nationalsecurity. The law on safeguarding national security in HK is a SWORD deterring people who endanger national security and a GUARDIAN protecting the majority of HK residents.
The purpose of the law is to plug the deadly loopholes that had prevented HK from guarding against #nationalsecurity threats. "#OneCountryTwoSystems", capitalist system, the high degree of autonomy and legal system remain unchanged.  
Why can't China enjoy the legitimate rights to safeguard its own #nationalsecurity?
#NationalSecurityLegislation is the sovereign right of a state & responsibility of the central govt. The #US has the most wide-ranging national security laws in various pretexts, e.g. foreign missions & foreign investment.  
Happy 99th Birthday!  The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people share the same dream. Those who attempt to distinguish the two are daydreaming.  
So ignorant! The CPC, with over 90 million members and together with their families, is an inseparable part and the faithful representative of all the Chinese people. The unbreakable bond between the CPC and the people is like that between flesh and blood.  
In the US, population of native Indians dropped from 5mln in 1492 to 250,000 in early 1900s, as a large number of them were killed during #WestwardExpansion. #GeorgeFloyd's death shows that US systemic racism has chocked ethnic minorities so hard that they "can't breathe".
Not the 1st time that #Pompeo cited false info and lied on Xinjiang. Adrian Zenz is a member of a far-right org set up by the US govt&a senior fellow of a "research group on Xinjiang's educational and training centers" set up&controlled by US intelligence agency.
Uyghur population in Xinjiang has grown from 5.55 million to 11.68 million in the past 40 years. If #Pompeo was telling the truth, how could such a substantial increase in population happen?  
Australia, an important eye of Five Eyes and a fervent intelligence gatherer, set up intel stations in China & bugged our Embassy. The US & its ally Australia are colluding to stage a farce of the spy crying "stop the spy".
An Australian lawmaker's home was searched because he praised China's #COVID19 response. China's interference in Australia's domestic affairs was implied. RIDICULOUS! If saying nice words about a country makes one a spy for that country, then how many spies for US do they have?
FYI, "Why is the US Exporting Coronavirus" by the NYT notes, the US is deporting thousands of illegal immigrants, many infected with #COVID19. A fifth of Guatemala's coronavirus cases were linked to US deportees. The US should act like a responsible country.
CDC Dir. Redfield said the actual number in the US could be 10 times more. 44,000 new cases on Jun. 27 is proof of the ineffectiveness of the blame game. US politicians should respect facts & science and stop lying and putting political expediency above people's lives.
Wuhan's closure on Jan. 23 made global headlines. US had only 1 publicly confirmed case then. Today it has 2.54 mln confirmed cases and 130,000 deaths, or 387 deaths per 1 mln people, respectively 30,27&129 times the numbers in China.
#Pompeo accused China again of covering up truth, but showed no evidence. It's because he has been telling downright lies to cover up US incapability of handling the pandemic.
Interested to hear the #US official comments on this.  
Very low.
This is another example of blatant political oppression & a demonstration of hypocrisy & double standard of the US "freedom of the press". The US should abandon its Cold-War mindset & ideological bias & avoid further isolating itself.
@StateDept again designated 4 Chinese media entities as foreign missions. If indeed Western media are "beholden to the truth", why is there so much blame of "fake news" in Washington? Who is lying then?
The High-level Video Conference on Belt and Road International Cooperation was held yesterday. All nations have their destinies closely connected. We cannot succeed without solidarity, cooperation and multilateralism.  
The Uyghur ethnic group enjoys equal rights and freedoms as the other 55 ethnic groups in China. The US should enact an African American Human Rights Policy Act instead of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act.  
The Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against #COVID19 was held successfully. With solidarity, humanity will ultimately defeat the virus, and the Chinese and African people are poised to embrace better days ahead.  
India must not misjudge the current situation or underestimate China's firm will to safeguard its territorial sovereignty.
Indian front-line troops broke the consensus and crossed the Line of Actual Control, deliberately provoking and attacking Chinese officers and soldiers, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties.
Documents of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service reveal that the detention of the Chief Financial Officer #MengWanzhou of Huawei is INDEED a highly political conspiracy of the US and Canada.  
The Canton Fair goes online for the first time.
Plain narrative of China's response to #COVID19 is NOT disinformation, while attacking and smearing China IS. In the face of vicious lies and disinformation, telling the true story of China is just like striking a match in the darkness.
When HK was under the British colonial rule, the British Treason Act was applied with special enforcement agencies. There's no reason for the UK to play double standards. We hope the British side will respect China's right to safeguard its territorial integrity&national security.
Why so angry? Because they can no longer jeopardize China's national security as recklessly as before. This proves again the necessity & urgency of the legislation.
Nearly 3 million Hong Kong people signed up to support the national security legislation. Only certain foreign forces jumped high to protest.
The motive behind this laughable scene is not that simple. Another proof that some in the US are deliberately creating & spreading disinformation against China.   
Such flawed paper was widely spread by some US politicians & media as new "evidence" of China's cover-up.  
For some US politicians, if someone doesn't follow the US to attack China, he/she must have been coerced by China. That's narrow-minded. The world is diverse and everyone should have the right to make independent decisions and choices.  
The China-Singapore fast lane was launched yesterday. Our fast lanes with the ROK and Germany have also been implemented with good results. We'll continue to facilitate essential business and official travels while containing the pandemic.
Write history with facts, leaving behind an objective and truthful account as part of the collective memory of humanity.  
All lives matter. We stand firmly with our African friends. We strongly oppose all forms of racial discrimination and inflammatory expressions of racism and hatred.
THUGS & HEROES HYPOCRISY  
"I can't breathe."  
If the #US has no intention to interfere, why is it so mad and afraid? The national security legislation is just like a security door to better protect the safety and freedom inside. Why would anyone be mad with others for installing a security door at their own home?
The national security legislation for #HongKong targets only activities of secession, subverting state power, organizing and carrying out terrorist activities, and foreign interference in Hong Kong affairs.
In any country including the #US, the central government holds the primary and ultimate responsibility for national security in all sub-national administrative regions.
Some #US politician clamored that the national security legislation for #HKSAR breached the Joint Declaration and China may "take over" Hong Kong. Ridiculous. Hong Kong is part of China. Could someone be accused of taking over his own hand?
The Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed to address #HongKong's return to China. There are 8 paragraphs with 1,137 words and 3 annexes in the Joint Declaration, with no single word that gives the #UK any responsibility over Hong Kong after its return.
Chinese survey team reached the summit of Mount Qomolangma and remeasured the height of the world's highest peak.        There is no mountain insurmountable.  
The national security legislation for Hong Kong is not aimed to undermine freedom but to prevent "Hong Kong independence" activities and other radical separatists.
The story of Hong Kong demonstrates how important it is to have a correct narrative and memory of history. The people in Hong Kong are enjoying rights that they never had before 1997.
US officials have made too many false accusations against China based on wrong knowledge. They'd better have careful study before speaking.  
How many laws on national security does the #US have? If the US can have legislation on almost everything in the name of #NationalSecurity, why can't China have one to prevent "#HongKong independence" activities and other radical separatists in part of her territory?
Interesting to hear some US official talking about the story of vaccine. Is this the normal logic that if anyone has something better than mine, then it must be stolen from me? Remember, China has 5000 years of history while the US has less than 250.  
We urge the #US side to fully appreciate the great sensitivity of the Taiwan question. We advise the US side to ditch its illusions and political calculations. We ask the US side not to make any attempt to challenge China's red line.
In the face of #COVID19, those attempts to attack or blackmail #WHO are lacking in basic humanity and will be rejected by the international community.
Nothing is more precious than people's lives; nothing is more important than saving lives. To support #WHO is to support saving lives. I believe all countries with decency will choose to do so.
#WHO is an international body made up of 194 sovereign states. It does not serve any particular country, and it should not defer to any country that provides more funding than others.
What we are seeing is this: those countries that heeded and followed WHO advice are more successful in bringing the virus under control, while those that ignored or rejected its advice are paying a heavy price.
As for WHO's international standing and its place in history, I'm sure clear-eyed people the world over will reach a fair conclusion, one that will not be altered just because some country doesn't like it. Those who throw mud at WHO will only leave a stain on themselves.
We hope all countries will realize that humanity is a community with a shared future. We must render each other more support and cooperation, and there should be less accusation or confrontation. We call on all nations to come together and build a better world for all.
No matter what stage of development it reaches, China will never seek hegemony. Those who go out of their way to label China as a hegemon are precisely the ones who refuse to let go of their hegemonic status.
We will push back against any deliberate insult to resolutely defend our national honor and dignity. And we will refute all groundless slander with facts to resolutely uphold fairness, justice and human conscience.
We Chinese value peace, harmony, sincerity and integrity. We never pick a fight or bully others, but we have principles and guts.
One has to have a sense of right and wrong. Without it, a person cannot be trusted, and a country cannot hold its own in the family of nations.
If anybody thought they could use some ludicrous lawsuits to undermine China's sovereignty and dignity or to deprive the Chinese people of their hard-won gains, they'd be daydreaming and bring disgrace to themselves.
Today's China is not what it used to be a hundred years ago, nor is the world anything like the one from a century ago.
These people are trampling on international rule of law and betraying human conscience. Their action does not square with facts, stand up to reason or have any legal foundation.
Some people are clamoring for so-called "accountability and compensation" from a victim of #COVID19 and fabricating so-called "evidence" for frivolous lawsuits.
China's record of #COVID19 response is there for the world to see, with a clear timeline and solid data that will stand the test of time and history.
The attempt to file frivolous lawsuits is a shoddy one, as it has zero basis in fact, law or international precedence.
#COVID19 is an unprecedented crisis. It requires China and the EU to rise above ideological differences, dispel self-fulfilling suspicions and send a common message of solidarity and cooperation.
China-EU interaction should be a positive cycle that enables our mutual success, not a knock-out match which results in only one winner.
China and the EU are not each other's systemic rivals. They are comprehensive strategic partners.
All countries closely related to the virus should be  covered by the field mission. The whole process should be open, transparent, objective and rational.
The process of identifying the source of the virus must be free from political interference, respect the sovereign equality of nations and avoid a presumption of guilt.
China is open to joint efforts by the international science community to identify the source of the virus. Importantly, it must be a professional, impartial and constructive process.
History should be written with facts, not tainted by lies. The global narrative about #COVID19 should reflect reason and conscience. Humanity has an obligation to leave behind an objective and truthful account as part of its collective memory.
Regarding the source of the virus, the difference between China and some US politicians is as wide as that between facts and lies, between science and prejudice.
We have every reason to be more confident in Hong Kong's future.
It does not affect the high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong. It does not affect the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents. And it does not affect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors in Hong Kong.
The NPC decision is targeted at a narrow category of acts that seriously jeopardize national security.
Under such circumstances, establishing a legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the Hong Kong SAR has become a pressing priority.  We must get it done without the slightest delay.
Excessive unlawful foreign meddling in Hong Kong affairs has placed China's national security in serious jeopardy.
This is the basic theory and principle underpinning national sovereignty and a common practice in countries around the globe.
The central government is responsible for upholding national security. This is the same in any country. The central government holds the primary and ultimate responsibility for national security in all sub-national administrative regions.
Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs and allow no external interference. Non-interference, as a basic norm of international relations, must be observed by all countries.
We try to be a friend in need, a sincere partner to be counted on in times of difficulty.
In providing assistance, we have but one goal, that is to save as many lives as possible. We have but one belief, that is one country's success does not mean the end of the global pandemic. It is only when the virus is defeated in all countries can we claim a true victory.
Nothing we do to help other countries' #COVID19 response is out of geopolitical calculation, or in pursuit of economic gains, or with any political strings attached.
We are aware that some political forces are mischaracterizing our intention. But we have done everything in the open and we have a clear conscience.
The two countries have supported and defended each other against slanders and attacks coming from certain countries. Together, China and Russia have forged an impregnable fortress against the "political virus" and demonstrated the strength of China-Russia strategic coordination.
After #COVID19, our economy will emerge stronger and more resilient, our people more united and confident in socialism with Chinese characteristics, and our nation more unstoppable in its march toward great rejuvenation.
The world will never be the same again, and China will never stop moving forward.
Pointing fingers at others will only end up damaging one's own reputation. Self-conceit and blame-shifting will not help one solve its own problems. Still worse, it will hurt other countries' legitimate rights and interests.
#COVID19 drives home once again that no country, no matter how strong it is, can insulate itself from a global challenge. When a disaster wreaks havoc, watching from an apparently safe distance and sitting idle will eventually backfire.
China and the US should and must find a way of peaceful co-existence and mutually beneficial cooperation, demonstrating that this is possible between two countries with different systems and cultures.
China will defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, its legitimate right to development, and its dignity and place in the world which the Chinese people have worked so hard to earn.
Some political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a "new Cold War". This is a dangerous attempt to turn back the wheel of history.
China has no intention to change, still less replace, the US. It's time for the US to give up its wishful thinking of changing China or stopping the 1.4 billion Chinese people's historical march toward modernization.
China and the US have different social systems, but this is the result of the different choices made by our people, which we must respect. It's also true that we have many disagreements, but that doesn't preclude cooperation.
Both China and the US stand to gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation: this best captures what we have learned, positive and otherwise, from the past decades. Both sides should take this lesson to heart.
Some politicians ignore the basic facts and make up countless lies and conspiracy theories concerning China. The longer the list, the more it says about how low the rumor-mongers are willing to go and the more stains they will leave in history.
It is most regrettable that while the coronavirus is still out there, a "political virus" is also spreading in the US and jumping at any opportunity to attack and slander China.
Having claimed so many precious lives, #COVID19 serves as a stark reminder that countries must rise above differences in geography, race, history, culture and social system. We must work together for a community with a shared future.
The virus respects no borders or races. Political manipulation will give the virus loopholes to exploit; a beggar-thy-neighbor approach will leave each of us more vulnerable; rejection of science will allow the virus to wreak greater havoc.
Also, it has never been made so clear to us that all nations live in the same global village and that humanity is in fact a community with a shared future.
The most important thing we could learn from #COVID19 is that the life and health of people in different countries have never been so closely connected.
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met the press through big screens on the sidelines of National People's Congress. Key messages as follows:
Tuned in from 9am for the opening session of 3rd session of 13th National People's Congress.  
#WHO is a UN specialized agency. Roughly 90% of its leadership are US experts. WHO bows to no individual or country. It serves the health and welfare of all mankind.
"Follow me and you live, defy me and you die." Is this the American style of science and democracy? But history has proven that only by following the trend of the times can one develop and prosper.
Scientists at the US NIH began developing a #COVID19 vaccine on January 11. There were reports of cases as early as November last year. Any explanation or investigation?
Just to list a few: US claimed only 1 case as Wuhan was closed on Jan23 US had 1896 cases as it declared national emergency on Mar13 US had 7087 cases as China reported 0 new domestic cases on Mar19  Now US has 1,570,583 cases&93,533 deaths  Who on earth should be accountable?
US non-stop disinformation may confuse and mislead some for a while. But in the end facts speak for themselves.
Not the first time to base decision-making on disinformation. RlDlCULOUS.  
That what does not kill you can only make you stronger.  
Kill whatever you don't like or fear whatever is better than yours. Does this speak for the entire American people or just the logic of a few of US politicians?  
President Xi called on all countries to work together to build a global community of health for all.
China will work with other #G20 members to implement the Debt Service Suspension Initiative for the poorest countries. China is also ready to work with the intl community to support the hardest-hit countries under the greatest strain of debt service to tide over the difficulties.
#COVID19 vaccine development and deployment in China, when available, will be made a global public good. This will be China's contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries.
China will establish a cooperation mechanism for its hospitals to pair up with 30 African hospitals and accelerate the building of the Africa CDC headquarters to help the continent ramp up its disease preparedness and control capacity.
China will work with the #UN to set up a global humanitarian response depot and hub in China, ensure the operation of anti-epidemic supply chains and foster "green corridors" for fast-track transportation and customs clearance.
Mankind is a community with a shared future. Solidarity & cooperation is our most powerful weapon for defeating the virus, a key lesson from fighting HIV/AIDS, Ebola, avian influenza, H1N1 and other major epidemics. It's also a sure way where the world can defeat this virus.
China supports the idea of a comprehensive review of the global #COVID19 response after it's brought under ctrl to sum up experience and address deficiencies. This should be based on science & professionalism, led by #WHO and conducted objectively & impartially.
President Xi: At this crucial juncture, to support #WHO is to support international cooperation and the battle for saving lives. China calls on the intl community to increase political and financial support for WHO.
President Xi Jinping made a statement at the virtual event of the opening of the 73rd World Health Assembly.  
Sorry for the misspelling. Thanks for pointing it out. I correct it now.
Deepest condolences to my colleague Ambassador Du Wei to Israel!
Deepest condolences to my colleage Ambassador Du Wei to Isreal!
"Express Access" between China and some European countries will soon start. Welcome back!  
Dr. Galea, @WHO's representative in China, wrote a letter in Chinese characters, a heartwarming reply to Wuhan students.
Happy #InternationalNursesDay! We salute the brave people protecting us all!  
Today marks the 12th anniversary of #Wenchuan #Earthquake. We will never forget the helping hands in those difficult times. The Chinese nation only emerges more united and resilient from each and every disaster.
美国关于新冠肺炎疫情的涉华谎言与事实真相  
24 LIES & FACTS about #COVID19  
China made great sacrifice for the victory of #WWII 75 years ago. Now we are fighting in another war. With solidarity, we will win again!  
China won't be Iraq.  
The #US keeps calling for transparency & investigation. Why not open up Fort Detrick & other bio-labs for international review? Why not invite #WHO & int'l experts to the US to look into #COVID19 source & response?
Resolution 2758 adopted by UNGA in October 1971 recognized PRC as the only legitimate representative of China in the UN. This has long resolved once & for all China's representation in the UN politically, legally & in terms of procedures. UNGA resolutions must be upheld.
China supports #WHO in reviewing global response to #COVID19 in an open, transparent & inclusive manner according to IHR at an appropriate time after the pandemic is over and hopes the US will also give its support & cooperation.
China's data is not true? Don't assume others are lying just because their numbers look better than yours. As behind every number is a life, a family. China's data can stand the test of history.
China didn't act fast enough over #COVID19? Let FACTS & TRUTHS tell the story. Who didn't act fast enough, China or the #US? It's as plain as day. Just count the numbers & compare.
China has paid its assessed contribution & peacekeeping assessment for 2020 in full, supporting #UN with concrete action. Paying assessed contributions on time & in full is the obligation of every member state, especially major countries.
China's Guangxi province donated 6,000 surgical masks & 4,000 gloves to Flying Tiger veterans & their relatives through American Flying Tiger Historical Organization. A token of friendship forged & deepened in our joint fight in WWII and against #COVID19.
What happened to Dr. Helen Chu, Capt. Crozier, Dr. Rick Bright & many others? Why was time data on January cases deleted from Florida Health Dept website? How much more truth was buried? Blame-shifting won't bring back lost lives.
Confirmed cases in the US surged from 1 to 1 million in less than 100 days. What has the US government done? WHO sent out a clear warning. Some countries heeded the call and took action. But not the US. Why?  
Renowned Columbia University economist Jeffrey D. Sachs said US administration's big lie that China is the cause of America's problems reminds one of the McCarthy era. "You have done enough. Have you no shame?" Indeed, ENOUGH LIES.  
China commends #EU for initiating Int'l Pledging Conference. China is joining ACT Accelerator&working with @CEPIvaccines & @gavi for global #COVID19 response. China backs #G20 debt moratorium&suspends debt repayments for 77 developing countries from May 1 to the end of this year.
The #US is pressuring other countries in smear campaign against China. The choice is NOT between the US and China, but between LIES & FACTS, bullying & cooperation, unilateralism & multilateralism.
#WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said French #COVID19 case in December without link to China "gives us a whole new picture on everything" and urged countries to retest cases of atypical pneumonia in Nov-Dec 2019.  
Scientists are speaking out based on facts. With CNN on 27, Mr Horton said the world should be grateful to China & WHO. Just now, he again stressed blaming China for #COVID19 is unhelpful, wrong and factually untrue.
Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng's Exclusive Interview on #COVID19 with NBC  
Did the famous "Ron Vara" say it? Fake tests? Vacuum up PPE? China has sound cooperation with US FDA to ensure exports meet US quality standards. From Mar. 1 to Apr. 24 China has provided nearly 3.5 bil. masks, 300 mil. gloves & 5,800+ ventilators to #US.  
The playbook for Blaming China has been exposed. Better stop and take back its systematic and organized attack, slander and defamation on China.
CPC is open, transparent & responsible in #COVID19 response. 2 US experts were in China on WHO-China joint mission in late Jan. Why not ask US experts to locate when the virus first started in the US? American people need answers. The world also has right to know.  
WHO is a central force in coordinating the global response, and is indispensable for helping developing countries, especially our African brothers and sisters, in fighting the disease. Supporting the WHO helps us save more lives.
China calls for understanding and respect for all countries' efforts based on their own situations. Collaborative response should never be distracted by finger-pointing or blame game. New tensions and divisions should never be created due to politicization or stigmatization.
China actively conducts intl cooperation. We empathize with others suffering from similar difficulties. Only when #COVID19 is uprooted globally can the health&safety of Chinese be protected. We help out of humanitarianism, not ideological agenda or selfish geopolitical interests.
Should we let science and reason prevail or create political divisions, bolster intl cooperation or isolate through decoupling, promote multilateralism or unilateralism? We all need to answer these questions in a way that stands the test of history.
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the BRICS Foreign Ministers' Extraordinary Conference on #COVID19  
#Pompeo on FOX again accusing China of #COVID19 cover-up. But who is spreading disinformation? Isn't it clear enough as disclosed by #NRSC Memo and #Grayzone? Stop playing the political game. Better save energy on saving lives.
What a playbook. Have a look!  
Lisang Dagat, a song from Chinese Embassy in the Philippines, lyrics by Chinese Ambassador,  dedicated to those contributed to the fight against #COVID19, with special thanks to China Medical Expert Team. We sang together & we all fight together!  
 
Beijing Municipal Government linked up with its 26 sister cities of 21 countries. China's best practices in containing #COVID19 were shared. This is the Chinese way to push forward cooperation.  
As of Apr. 20, China had provided the US with over 2.46 bn masks, meaning 7 masks for each in the US, pⅠus nearly 5,000 ventilators & many others. Hope that couⅠd save more lives.
 
Cooperation between Chinese & US medical workers is going on.
At this crucial moment, supporting WHO is supporting Multilateralism and Global Solidarity.
China has decided to donate additional $30 million in cash to WHO to support its global fight against #COVID19, in particular strengthening developing countries' health systems. China already donated $20 million in cash to WHO on March 11.
Facts and truth about China's fight against #COVID19.  
Wuhan and Los Angeles had a video link-up on reopening the cities and resuming business. Wuhan University and Ohio State University also had a conference on management during #COVID19.  
FACTS speak all. Above all, the first priority is to SAVE LIVES!
Right decisions can only be built on Facts. Some people in the US should know that their enemy is the virus, not China.
Chinese Medical experts team arrived in Malaysia!  
Medical supplies from China were delivered to Moldova on a Russian aircraft. Only by joining each other, we can battle #COVID19.
Any country hit by #COVID19 is the victim and suffers. Our common enemy is the VIRUS! Only when the world fight in solidarity can we win the battle!   
- Supporting WHO is supporting multilateralism. Groundless attacks against WHO find no support - WHO is needed to continue its key role to combat #COVID19 - Virus is a common enemy and must be defeated with unity
State Councilor & Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with @WHO Dr. Tedros:   
Chinese medical supplies arrived in South Africa, with love, as expressed by local newspaper. We always stand together with our African brothers&sisters.  
On 13th, State Councilor&FM Wang Yi said to AUC Chairperson Moussa Faki: China treats all foreigners in China equally and opposes differential practices targeting specific communities. China-Africa traditional friendship will not be disturbed by instigation of some forces.
Has Mr. Carr heard the many whistles sounded in Jan. and Feb. in the US? Has he heard the crying American medical workers? Maybe he should talk to them first.
The key is that the CPC puts people's lives above everything else & every infected got free test and treatment at the earliest possible opportunity. This is why the CPC enjoys the highest supporting rate around the world.
China, with the strictest measures and quickest response, managed to bring the unknown virus under control and minimize infection and mortality rates within 2 months when its 1.4 billion people were at the height of the Spring Festival travel season.
Brendan Carr listed several Chinese names whom he'd like to talk to. He is welcome to Wuhan to pay respects to the heroic city. But Plz don't pretend to be a detective. Wuhan's success is a reality, not a fiction.
Premier Li Keqiang at the Special 10+3 Summit on #COVID19: China is ready to send an additional 100 mil. masks, 10 mil. protective suits&other urgently needed medical supplies to ASEAN countries. And more expert teams if needed.
3/3 China with 1.4 billion population and a land of 9.6 million km², has contained the epidemic. Come on and stay strong the US!
2/3 The US was formally notified in early Jan, US experts were in China in late Jan and its consulate in Wuhan closed on Jan 25. The US shut down border to China on Feb 2. Unfortunately, two months on, the US has  the most infections and deaths.
1/3 #COVID19 is an unknown virus to mankind. China was the first to report it and has responded openly, transparently and responsibly and put it under control in about 2 months.
Life comes first, nothing is more important than life. China has provided many needed supplies to the US to help American medical workers get better protection and save more American lives from danger.
The coronavirus death toll topped 20,000 in the US. Photos show stacks of coffins were being buried on Hart Island. Their families were absent and unable to visit. So heartbreaking!  
The Chinese government is in close communication with our African brothers to ensure proper handling of the individual case. China-African friendship will never be shaken by wedge-driving attempt.
China's prevention and control measures are equally applied to Chinese and foreign citizens alike and isolated phenomenon doesn't represent Chinese government's policy. Asian Americans experienced racism during the pandemic. How would @statedeptspox explain that?
@statedeptspox is lying. During the pandemic, African friends esp. students have been taken good care of in China. 3,000 African students remain safe and sound in Wuhan.
Coronavirus is a virus unseen and unknown by mankind. China is the first to stand the test and responded with effective measures. How about the US? while other countries’ experience is available at hand?
WHO warned about the risk of human-to-human transmission of #COVID19 as early as 10 Jan in its note of guidance and urged precautions even though initial Chinese studies at that point had found no clear evidence of that route of infection.
Navarro said China has been trying to gain control of intl orgs by using colonial type proxies. He should know the US has long occupied many more leading positions and has more employees in intl orgs. So the US has the biggest number of proxies in intl orgs?
My way or the high way, put a hold on funding. Is this the right way of responsible country?International organizations are expected to serve the world, not a single country alone, though a superpower.  
China is the 1st to report and share virus data with WHO and other countries. WHO joint mission including 2 US experts already visited Wuhan and commended China's efforts. When will Washington invite joint international expert team to the US for investigation?
Welcome to China anytime and talk to anyone in the streets to enjoy the freedom. BTW Where is freedom & transparency when Captain Crozier was dismissed for a letter to save thousands of lives and medical workers fired for talking about working conditions?  
China opposes any attempt to use the epidemic for purpose of politicization or stigmatization. We strongly condemn the personal attacks and racist words and deeds against @WHO DG Tedros.  
Yes, now is the time for unity, of the whole world! This is a war between HUMAN and VIRUS. No one could be excluded. Apart, the humanity will suffer more. Together, we will win.  
US Congressman Mark Green said China told France to implement 5G with Huawei in exchange for a billion masks during a phone call between the two heads of state. How could he know? French President's office would tell him that? FAKE NEWS with sinister intentions.
The Spectator USA published an article saying "China forced Italy to buy back the Personal Protective Equipment supply it gave to China during the initial coronavirus outbreak". However, an Italian journalist found it was FAKE NEWS.🇨🇳&🇮🇹are true friends throughout difficult time.
China was the 1st to report the unknown virus and strove to contain it. As the Lancet editor-in-chief Horton said, "we knew in the last week of Jan that this was coming. The message from China was absolutely clear".
Accusing China of coverup is a kind of blackmail. Suspected cases were reported on 27Dec. Reuters cited CCTV reports on 31. We formally notified WHO on 3Jan&closed Wuhan on 23. US closed its Consulate on 26& borders to China on 2Feb. Blameshifting can't make up for lost time.
As UN spokesman said, it's clear that WHO, under Dr Tedros' leadership, has done tremendous work on COVID. WHO is showing the strength of the intl health system. We need solidarity and cooperation than ever to win the fight!
"Timeline of China releasing information on COVID-19 and advancing international cooperation" released.   FACTS speak louder than words.   
Secretary Locsin warmly welcomed China's Medical Expert Team. We are close neighbors. We're glad to share our experience and hope the Philippine people will soon win the battle!  
If this 7-year-old girl has the common sense, why some adults don't? 👇  
4/4 There are over 90 million CPC members in China, about one-third of the total US population. The CPC comes from the people & serves the people. Attempt to drive a wedge between the CPC & the Chinese people is futile.
3/4 Why the Chinese Government enjoys the highest supporting rate: over 800 million people have been pulled out of poverty; everyone has medical insurance; each #COVID19 patient enjoys timely, free test & treatment; 1.4 billion people's life has been protected to the best.
2/4 The criteria for media should be truth, fairness and impartiality instead of ideology. China doesn't take any US media as propagandist just because it's pro-Republican. The US shouldn't oppress Chinese media out of ideological bias.
1/4 @StateDept Absurd excuses for expelling 60 Chinese reporters. Since China & the US established diplomatic ties 41 years ago, the US has known China is a socialist country led by the CPC.   
China is turning the pandemic into a geopolitical weapon? Will soldier think of reward amidst fierce battle? All we're preoccupied with now is save more lives & provide more assistance.
#Zakharova China will never retreat in the fight against #COVID19, as it concerns the life of the people. Work together to win this "Battle of Moscow" against virus. Victory belongs to all mankind! Победа будет за нами!  
An open letter to American people from 100 Chinese scholars. Time for more positive voices like this.  
Slanders & blame games cannot make up for lost time. More lies will only waste more time and cost more lives. People's lives should always be valued and placed ahead of  politics. It is immoral & inhumane to politicize such a serious public health crisis.  
 
The timeline of China's response is very clear. Could the US have done better than China? What has the US done in the two months since CDC issued warnings on Jan 15? Why in Feb Dr. Helen Chu was told to "stop testing"? Why did CDC stop releasing data on tests & deaths on Mar 2?
We should listen to WHO & experts on epidemiology & disease control rather than habitual liars. Fact-based scientific and professional assessment by scientists & experts should be valued and respected. And why not arrange an investigation trip to the US by international experts?
2/2 Masks of various category offer different levels of protection, for day-to-day use and for medical purposes. Pls Double-check the instructions to make sure that you ordered, paid for and distributed the right ones. Do not use non-surgical masks for surgical purposes.
1/2 China export "defective" masks to the Netherlands? True story about masks purchased by a Dutch procurement agent: the Chinese manufacturer stated clearly that they are non-surgical & the exported customs clearing procedures were also under the name of "non-surgical masks".
Fully agree. No country could face this pandemic alone, and the international community needs solidarity and cooperation more than ever. Hope all will support the UN and WHO's coordinating work to win the battle.
China is practicing "mask propaganda"? Do those badmouthing China rather want us to stand by & turn blind to others' suffering? This is all we do: reciprocate kindness and help others to the best of our ability.
Chinese companies are working around the clock to make more medical supplies for those suffering from #COVID19. The responsibility and contributions of the Chinese people deserve respect instead of smears.
The open letter by @WSJ @washingtonpost @nytimes was wrongly addressed. It should be sent to the US government. When the US government announced to expel 60 Chinese journalists on March 2, did anyone speak out?
President Xi said in phone conversation with Polish President Duda: The power&confidence in winning the battle against the epidemic come from the Chinese people. People are the real heroes. As long as relying fully on the people, China will overcome all difficulties and obstacles
3/3 Some US official says Chinese journalists are not real ones as they speak for the CPC. Then can we say US reporters speaking for Republicans are not real journalists? The real criteria should be objectivity and impartiality instead of ideological prejudice.
2/3 The US accuses China of obstructing information flow, but when they expelled 60 Chinese journalists, what were they afraid of? What were they trying to cover up? Did they really believe they can silence a country like China without any consequences?
1/3 Since 2018 the US has denied visas for 29 Chinese journalists. On Mar 2, US StateDept announced de facto expulsion of 60 Chinese journalists by Mar 13. As a countermeasure, China announced to revoke a dozen US journalists' press cards on Mar 18. @statedeptspox  
2/2 Indeed, saving lives is more important than saving face! Be honest and responsible!   
1/2 Heard about the story of plugging ears while stealing bell? Is this the so-called freedom of information? Don't the American people have the right to know the truth? Will self-deception and smearing China help with epidemic response?  
China launched WeDoctorGCPC, AliHealth and Baidu Ask Doctor global aid platform. We hope these platforms can not only help our Chinese nationals, but all people suffering from #COVID19.  
中方推出“微医互联网总医院全球抗疫平台“，“阿里健康海外侨胞在线医疗咨询专区”，和“百度问医生全球公益援助平台”。希望这些医疗平台不仅能帮助海外同胞，也能对其他国家遭受新冠肺炎疫情的人民有用。  
100,000 test kits, 100,000 surgical masks, 10,000 N95 masks, and 10,000 sets of personal protective equipment have arrived in the Philippines. Hope they will help our Philippine friends.
Chinese medical experts arrived in Serbia with over ten tons of medical supplies, including ventilators, masks and testing kits. Serbian President Vučić, Health Minister and Defence Minister welcomed the Chinese friends at the airport.  
On Mar. 13 three leading Chinese experts held a video conference with over 300 US scientists & specialists to share experience on #COVID19. The know-how they shared will help save lives in the US. Virus is the REAL enemy! Cooperation is the only right way to win the battle.
On Jan 25 President Trump tweeted to appreciate and thank China's efforts & transparency. The same day US StateDept started to withdraw its consulate in Wuhan. On Feb 2 the travel ban was applied to China. What have you done since then? Scapegoating China doesn't help.
You may not know that Wuhan Health Commission issued a notice on December 31? Please take some time to understand the situation before you speak. @statedeptspox
China has treated #COVID19 as highly pathogenic virus according to the law on prevention & treatment of infectious diseases. As WHO stated, China identified the pathogen in a record short time & shared genetic sequence with the world, which helped others with epidemic response.
Lying and slander won't make the US great, nor will it make up for the lost time. Facing the global pandemic, the right thing to do is put public health ahead of politics. @statedeptspox
The US AID promised to give some medical supplies to China, but was not ready until March 11. Given the fast spreading of the pandemic around the world, we have thanked the US and suggested to give them to those more needed asap.
Why not send a WHO expert group to US to investigate? US CDC estimates this season flu has so far sickened at least 36 million people and killed 22,000. CDC Director admitted some were actually #COVID19. American people need & deserve more detailed, transparent explanation.  
In 2015, WHO issued Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases, saying that disease names may NOT include geographic locations & should avoid causing offence to any national, regional, or ethnic groups.  
US officials said they offered $100 million to China and other countries. We thank the American people for their kind help. But as a matter of fact, we haven’t received $1 from the US government. By the way, has the US paid its dues to WHO?
#Pompeo said to Fox News "China has allowed hundreds of thousands of people to leave Wuhan to go to places like Italy that's now suffering so badly" . Stop lying through your teeth! As WHO experts said, China's efforts averted hundreds of thousands of infection cases.  
US officials say that China demands a few American journalists to leave in its countermeasures because China fears what they write about the pandemic. If so, then what is the US afraid of when it asked 60 Chinese journalists to leave by March 13?
If the US is truly confident of the supremacy of its political system, why are they so afraid of the Communist Party of China and Chinese media?!
Our arduous efforts have paid off: On March 18, Hubei Province (including Wuhan) reported 0 new confirmed cases, 0 new suspected cases and 0 suspected cases pending results.  
China has been updating the US on the coronavirus and its response since Jan. 3. On Jan. 15 the US State Department notified Americans in China US CDC's warning about the coronavirus. And now blame China for delay? Seriously?
We reject ideological bias against China, reject fake news made in the name of press freedom, reject breaches of ethics in journalism.
我们反对针对中国的意识形态偏见，反对借所谓新闻自由炮制假新闻，反对违反新闻职业道德的行为！
长期以来美方对中国媒体驻美记者采取歧视性限制措施。美方大量驱逐中方驻美记者是对中国媒体政治歧视和打压的又一升级行为。  
The US expulsion of Chinese journalists was an upgraded evidence of political oppression. For too long, the Chinese journalists have been unfairly treated under the discriminatory policies of the US.   
President Xi talked with visiting Pakistani President. Pakistani people have given all they have to help China at outbreak of the epidemic. Once again we prove we are iron brothers sharing weal & woe. China stands with Pakistan. Our iron-clad friendship will be further deepened.  
Some US political figures have kept discrediting China and China's epidemic response and stigmatizing China. Any scheme to slander and smear China has no chance of success; any action that harms China's interests will be pushed back firmly and resolutely.  
President Xi told PM Conte via phone that China firmly supports Italy and has full confidence in its victory. China feels what Italy's going through and will send more medical experts & supplies. Friendship & mutual trust will emerge stronger in our joint battle against #COVID19.
State Councilor Wang Yi told Spanish FM Gonzales: China will provide medical supplies and facilitate imports of PPEs & medical devices. We'll arrange Experts' video conferences and are considering to send medical teams to Spain.
State Councilor Wang Yi  just called with Philippine FM Locsin. We feel the same as the Philippine people are going through difficult times. We will do our utmost to help. Medical supplies and experts will soon go to the Philippines.
Amid the Chinese anthem playing out in Rome, Italians chanted "Grazie, Cina!". In this community with a shared future, we share weal and woe together.  
We met after 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in China, and again we meet against #COVID19 in Italy. We are family, we are together.  A drawing –– Tutto Andrà bene (Everything will be fine) by Aurora Cantone #aurs_artt  
Chinese medical professionals have arrived in Italy, delivering their expertise and support to the people. My colleague, Chinese Ambassador to Italy,  received them at the airport.
@CDCDirector Dr. Robert Redfield: Some cases that were previously diagnosed as Flu in the US were actually #COVID19. It is absolutely WRONG and INAPPROPRIATE to call this the Chinese coronavirus.  
Science is the best weapon against #COVID19. Protecting people's lives depends on science-based measures. Face up to truth & facts. No more politically-motivated attacks & senseless blame game! Please heed CDC experts' advice and the world's voice. 
It seems that some US officials enjoy smearing China around the clock & around the world. What they say about Xinjiang is the LIE of the CENTURY. LYING and CHEATING won't make you nobler and greater. Why not come to Xinjiang and see with your own eyes?  
The most outstanding Chinese expert sharing experience with his European colleagues online. His point: Isolating the infected from the healthy, which is recognized by WHO as effective.  Proud of our National Treasure scientists!  
A batch of medical supplies have arrived in Belgium; 1.8 million masks and 100,000 reagents are on the way. The supplies will then be delivered to Italy & Spain and to the frontline.  
Chinese medical experts have set off for Italy, carrying medical supplies to support people there fighting against #COVID19. They're ready to share their experience as well.
President Xi Jinping told medical workers on the frontline: I can't see your faces behind the masks. But you are the loveliest in my eyes, and in people's heart.
State Councillor & Foreign Minister Wang Yi called with his Italian counterpart Luigi Di Maio: China will provide masks and other medical supplies to Italy. Our sister cities/provinces & businesses will also step in to help. Fight on, Italy! 🇮🇹 We're with you! #COVID19
In face of the spreading #COVID19, some are still obsessed with the superiority of its own ideology?! VIRUS KNOWS NO POLITICS AND IDEOLOGY. What is imperative is to work together to fight against #COVID19 to save and protect as many people as possible and secure an early victory!
Foreign volunteers of various nationalities & professions are working on epidemic frontline in China. Frédéric Domeck is one of them. They are standing with the Chinese people to guard our homes in tough times. In China they are foreigners but not outsiders. #COVID19
Our sympathies go to all countries suffering from #COVID19. In this darkest hour, we need trust, support & cooperation to defeat the disease and disperse darkness.
#USTR 2019 Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance #Fairtrade policies must follow rules agreed by all instead of picking and choosing. It is the greatest unfairness to impose one’s will upon others. Remember, WTO Appellate Body is in limbo because of US obstruction.
“雾尽风暖，樱花将灿” 吹く風に温かさ知り花近し  憂いのない春を一緒に迎えましょう！  
 
We are together in the global fight against #COVID19.
Goggles and masks cannot hide your beautiful faces. We are all fighters, against coronavirus and political virus. We'll win in the end. Happy International Women’s Day!🌹  
A heartbreaking and inspiring moment.  Picture taken when a doctor wheeled a senior aged patient out for lab test. They stopped a while for the beautiful sunset.  
This video clip brought tears to my eyes. I see professionalism, responsibility, devotion, compassion and righteousness in Dr. Aylward. And we need more people like him at this trying moment. In hard times, ordinary people become extraordinary heroes.
오늘 오후 서울에서 코로나19와 싸우는 한국국민들한테  N95마스크 10만장, 의료용 외과 마스크 100만장을 포함한 지원 물자를 제공한다는 중국정부의 결정이  나의 동료 싱하이밍 주한 중국대사 통해  한국측에 전달되었네요. 한국 화이팅!  중한관계의  더 좋은 미래를 믿습니다✊.
Dr. Aylward, head of the China-WHO joint mission on #COVID19, said China's counterattack can be replicated, but it will require speed, money, imagination and political courage. Thanks for your professionalism, devotion, sacrifice and objectiveness. We are ready to share and give.
@JesseBWatters How ignorant and biased! Chinese people very hungry and underfed? Come watch A Bite of China  
Reciprocity? 29 US media agencies in China VS 9 Chinese ones in the US. Multiple-entry to China VS Single-entry to the US. 21 Chinese journalists denied visas since last year. Now the US kicked off the game, let's play.
@StateDept We condemn US "personnel cap" on Chinese media—de-facto expulsion. Another step of political oppression and evidence of hypocrisy in US freedom of press. Prejudice and exclusion against Chinese media.
어려움을 돕는 마음이 서로 같고 우려와 극복해야할 일도 같다. 공동의 시련 앞에서 중국의 관심과 온정을 보냅니다.  함께 힘냅니다!  
Could virus be so intelligent as to tell ideology and social system? Ridiculous! Political virus is extremely dangerous. All should be highly vigilant and reject it.
“救患若一，所忧同也” 救いを待つ人がいれば、それを助けたいという思いは中日両国ともに同じです。 同じ試練に立ち向かう日本の皆さん、中国からの気持ちをお受け取りください。 共同加油！一緒に頑張りましょう！  
A team of Chinese experts are now on their way to Iran. #COVID19 is enemy of all. We must fight together. Nothing could defeat the Iranian people! @IRIMFA @IRIMFA_EN @SAMOUSAVI9 @IraninChina
Sad to hear bad news in #Iran. 1st batch of Chinese assistance already arrived and more sure to follow. We are with you, Iran! Be strong, Iran! Hang in there, Iran! #COVID19
"Chinese people are never daunted by others' blames because we have confidence in ourselves, and in our country." Dr. Zhong Nanshan, the renowned respiratory disease expert is a real respectable hero!   
My thoughts are with people in ROK, Japan, Italy, Iran and others amid #COVID19 outbreak. We're ready to share information & experience, and collaborate in treatment, medication & vaccine development. Act in concert and unity, we will win! 🤝  
Astonished to hear @SecPompeo blaming China for the outbreak. What’s more dangerous & hazardous than #COVID19 is political virus out of political motives.
The US @StateDept designated five Chinese media organizations as foreign missions under the Foreign Mission Act. I wonder whether they will enjoy immunity of diplomatic agent as well?
It's not to praise China, but to open the door&have the rest of the world realize there's sth to be done as people start to despair, said Dr Aylward. We thank @WHO for its hard work, salute its professionalism and devotion. We'll keep working together to defeat our common enemy.  
"You are so beautiful when you smile. Go, Wuhan!"  A beautiful song in Chinese from pupils of Cascade Elementary School in Utah, USA, expressing their pure love for Chinese people. ❤
“The world’s in your debt,” said Dr Bruce Aylward from WHO. Changes on the ground reflect how determined we've been and united Chinese people are. All for one and one for all. Without any complacency, we'll carry on and stand with other countries until the ultimate victory.
Ms. Wang Binying has served in WIPO for over 30 years and now its Deputy DG. The US is lobbying around the world, threatening that "Anyone But China". Stop bullying and politicizing! Make the election fair!
As China’s fighting #COVID19 with unity & sacrifice, WSJ published an enraging editorial referring to the painful history of China, yet refused to correct and apologize. Still take China as over one century ago?
Freedom of press? Do not forget how the @WhiteHouse treated CNN. How many Chinese journalists were denied visas to the US?
A hit is a hit, no matter it is a left hook or a right one. Shifting blame between the two hands makes no sense.
As its own staff wrote, @WSJ chose a headline deeply offensive to many people, not just in China. Ignorance of other country's history and exploitation of other's pain is bad enough. Even worse is arrogance & prejudice, which will win no reputation at all.
My colleague Zhao Lijian @zlj517 made his public debut as MFA spokesperson. ImpressiveLucky to have him on board.  
"Finally, we must deplore the lies spread by govts and people who are stooping so low as to use a threat against all humanity as an instrument of geopolitical strategy." Like reading my mind. Can't agree more!
When Beijing saw its first snow in 2020, Lao Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith visited China. One month later, the PM gave State Councilor Wang Yi the supplies donated nationwide to support China's fight against #COVID19. The donation is valuable and the friendship is priceless.  
The world breaks everyone, and afterward many become stronger at the broken places.
Gratitude from the bottom of our hearts: Hard times reveal true friendship. We will cherish the kindness and assistance from our ASEAN friends. We believe the epidemic is short-lived while China-ASEAN friendship and cooperation endures.
Strong words from China. State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi: We firmly believe that China is fully capable and determined to prevail over the epidemic soon.  
中日両国は一衣帯水の隣国同士であり、ウイルスとの戦いに国境はありません。中国は、新型コロナウイルスの検査キットを日本に寄贈しました。💪  
Stay strong #Wuhan! Stay strong #China! Stay strong #ASEAN!  
Hand in hand, side by side. We are together. Thank you! ASEAN!  
Worst selling fiction! How about #CryptoLeaks scandal and Snowden stories?
State Councilor Wang Yi in Laos: With the friendship and support from #ASEAN and the international community, the winter is not that cold. After the test, our relationship will only be stronger!  
夜走了，天亮了 天空和钟声一同醒来 樱花在温暖的春风中飞扬 武汉，我们在等你 Night is gone & it is dawn Sky wakes up with the music of chime bells With cherry blossoms dance in spring breeze We are here waiting for you, Wuhan!  
“一衣带水，守望相助” 一衣帯水の隣国として、何かあればお互いに助け合いましょう。  
私たちは日本国内の新型肺炎の感染状況を注視し、日本の皆さんと同じ気持ちでいます。中国はウイルスとの戦いに取り組むと同時に、情報と経験を日本側と共有し、できる限りの支援を提供していきます。双方はすでに関係分野における協力に着手しました。
A bird view of Beijing after a shower of fresh snow. CITIC Tower China Zun is standing tall and braving the cold. Be Strong! China✊Go! China🌞  
Ambassador Richard Grenell tweeted on consequences of choosing an "untrustworthy" 5G vendor. Who he is threatening? Who's the real threat? Remember, Snowden said US spied on Chancellor Merkel's phone!
王毅外相は現地時間15日、ミュンヘンで日本の茂木外相と会談。王外相は「日本の各界が中国の新型肺炎との戦いを支援しているという話題は中国のネット上でもちきりとなっている。日本が差し伸べた支援の手から我々にその温もりが伝わって来る」と述べました。 @moteging  
Wang Yi: All US' accusations against China are lies, not facts. But if US is the accused, then these charges become facts and truths. We hope US not to lose its confidence and reason.  
Wang Yi: Collaboration between major countries is crucial to the success of multilateralism. Major countries need to behave in a way consistent with their status. Instead of putting their own interests above those of others, they should care for common interests of all countries.  
Wang Yi: After the storm comes the rainbow. When the epidemic is under control, China’s economic development will be even healthier and more sustainable. #COVID19  
Wang Yi: China is united as one. Wuhan is not fighting #COVID19 alone.  
Wang Yi: We have full confidence, capacity and determination to defeat the epidemic. The dawn is coming. Its first light can already be seen.  
Wang Yi: Many state leaders note it is admirable that the Chinese government&people show solid resolve in dealing with the epidemic. The high speed&massive scale of China’s response are rarely seen in the world. China’s speed, scale&efficiency reflect advantage of China’s system.  
State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is delivering a speech "Bringing the East and West Together in Shared Commitment to Multilateralism" at the Munich Security Conference.  
Wang Yi: Whether US&DPRK have sincerity to meet each other half way is the key to the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue. China’s approach of “phased&synchronized steps” will continue its positive role. We can’t afford losing de-escalation or shutting down the window of peace again.  
Wang Yi: 🇨🇳 played a major role in reaching Paris Agreement. Its emission reduction target is met ahead of schedule every year. Its new energy vehicles and renewable energy installed capacity are 50% and 1/3 of the world. China honors its commitment with actions, not slogans. 💪  
Wang Yi: Who threatens whom? US Congress kept passing acts to blatantly interfere in China’s internal affairs. US kept sending warships or aircrafts at China’s doorstep. It spares no efforts to batter Chinese companies. It’s US, not China, that threatens others.  
Wang Yi: Bashing #Huawei is out of a dark mindset. Why did US use state power to bash Huawei? Only because Huawei develops so well. UK, Germany and other countries don't believe in rumors, ready to offer Huawei fair market environment. This is a wise choice.   
Wang Yi: Preaching clash of civilizations attempts to reverse history. Nations are equal in the international community & enjoy right to development. Socialism with Chinese characteristics is the Chinese people’s choice. It’s so successful in China. US should respect this choice.  
Wang Yi: Like pure gold is tested in fire, we will be stronger & more united after this epidemic. China’s economy will be more stable & sustainable. 🇨🇳 Hard times reveal true friendship. Our friendship and trust with other countries will be stronger & deeper. 🌐  
Wang Yi: With Chinese speed, we race against time to save lives of every patient. With our strength united as one, we fight against #COVID19 and stop its further spread. With its efforts and sacrifice, China won international respect and recognition. 🇨🇳  
State Councilor Wang Yi is having an exclusive interview with Alessandra Galloni, Global News Editor with Reuters.  
On Feb. 13, Chancellor Merkel met with State Councilor Wang Yi in Berlin. She believes China will triumph over the epidemic and China will always have her support. "Ich wünsche China Kraft! 💪" (Go, China! ) Thank you Chancellor! We also believe we'll prevail. ❤  
No winter lasts forever, every spring is sure to follow.
