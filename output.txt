The so-called "Uyghur Tribunal" is neither legal nor credible. It will only make it easier for the world to see through the lies and rumors relating to #Xinjiang.  
There are more and more objective and rational voices in the world debunking the lies and rumors on Xinjiang.  
Using the word “tribunal” as a cover, it resorts to grandstanding to attack Xinjiang & meddle in China’s domestic affairs, which is both illegal & preposterous.  
It was patched together by the notorious anti-China separatist "World Uyghur Congress" in collusion with anti-China forces. Its speciality is producing &promoting lies to smear Xinjiang & meddle in China’s internal affairs with the end goal of splitting Xinjiang to contain China.
Given that BBC went so low with a royal celebrity, just imagine how ugly & hypocritical its geopolitical & ideological coverage is. It fabricated & spread so much disinformation on #China’s #Xinjiang.
From May 13 to 17, a 23-member delegation of ambassadors&senior diplomats from Latin American and Caribbean countries visited Urumqi, Turpan&Hotan in Xinjiang. Seeing the region as it is, the delegation expressed full support to Xinjiang's anti-terrorism&deradicalization efforts.  
The #US hypocrisy and conspiracy of creating "#HumanRights issues" in #Xinjiang to mess up and contain #China have been seen through by more and more people, including our #African brothers.  
We welcome all unbiased people to visit #Xinjiang. That said, we firmly reject so-called investigation with presumption of guilt by citing lies and rumors.
This further laid bare their intention to make an issue out of the human rights situation in Xinjiang to disrupt and contain China, and to divert people’s attention from their own past and on-going human rights crimes and incompetency in domestic governance and #COVID19 response.
They would rather play along with the clumsy show of a handful of anti-China forces than face up to the development and progress in #Xinjiang.
Those Western countries would rather believe the lies concocted by a few people than heed the voice of the 25 million people of all ethnic groups in #Xinjiang and the 1.4 billion Chinese.
If they truly care about human rights, why didn’t they invite residents from #Xinjiang to attend the event? If they truly care about human rights, why don’t they reflect upon and redress serious racial discriminatory polices and behavior at home?
The #US, #UK& #Germany ganged up with some NGOs to host a virtual conference on #Xinjiang’s human rights situation based on lies&political prejudice falsely in the name of UN.  
They want to create "forced industrial decoupling" & "forced unemployment" in #Xinjiang to serve their malicious agenda to disrupt Xinjiang and contain #China.
Xinjiang cotton is pure white and solar energy is clean, but those in the #US who hype up the issue have a dark and sinister intention.   
Some in the #US buy the "account" of the few false witnesses and experts, but refuse to listen to the voices far outnumbering those of false actors, and heed the call of 1.4 billion #Chinese people, including over 25 million people of all ethnic groups in #Xinjiang.
#Sweden-based TFF stressed "report" on genocide in #Xinjiang lacks credibility and the relevant #US think tank has obvious political aims.  
The script of making up lies on #Xinjiang: revelation by so-called “academics” or “victims” first, hype-up by media then, intervention from governments or parliaments in the end.  
We find "The #Xinjiang Genocide Allegations Are Unjustified" carried by the #US-based media organization Project Syndicate objective and informative. We applaud its just voice on Xinjiang related issues.  
A SCMP article points out how the West intentionally negated China's counter-terrorism achievements and accused China of "genocide" in Xinjiang.  
The latest documentary on Xinjiang shows a real Xinjiang through a collection of individual stories, which is different from what is told by the US and Western media. Have a look.  
The opinion is from a series on Xinjiang published by the Australian Alert Service, a publication of the Australian Citizens Party. Have a look.
Some Western countries, including the US, have supported separatist&terrorist activities in China's Xinjiang for geopolitical purposes.  
A company in Xinjiang filed a lawsuit against Adrian Zenz. It reflects a stronger rule-of-law awareness among the Chinese citizens, who use the law to safeguard their rights and interests. It’s great to see that happen.  
The US keeps maligning Xinjiang and weaving outrageous lies about China. Show your evidence and speak with facts!
NED is funded by and serves as an intermediary for the US government and congress. It doesn’t stop at fomenting unrest in Xinjiang, but handles dirty deeds all around the globe, including in Hong Kong.
NED also disclosed on its website that it has funded the World Uyghur Congress from East Turkestan. Who will call Xinjiang East Turkestan?  
The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) said on Twitter that they have funded separatist forces in #Xinjiang since 2004. Have a look at the self-styled flag of East Turkestan.  
If the US is bent on repeating lies for 1,000 times, we will repeat truth 10,000 times. Whether the US believes it or not, facts and truth about Xinjiang will stay unshakable like mountain and clear like lake. Lies on Xinjiang will collapse and attempt to contain China will fail.
Third, the US wants to cover up its own poor record on the treatment of Muslims. Why do they “care about” Muslims in Xinjiang only? Because they have inflicted much suffering on Muslims around the world and are just trying to divert the Muslim community’s anger.
Second, the US wants to drive a wedge between China and Muslim countries. 64 countries, including Muslim countries, support China on Xinjiang-related issues at 46th session of UN Human Rights Council. None of the Muslim countries buys US’ vicious conspiracy to sow discord.
Why has the US kept repeating the lie of genocide in Xinjiang? First, they want to contain China by disrupting Xinjiang. They are trying to smear the white, innocent cotton. The accusations of “genocide” & “forced labor” should better be left to the US itself
Please watch the 4th and latest #CGTN documentary on fighting terrorism in #Xinjiang. Facts abound to dispel the fallacies of the so-called "excessive counter-terrorism" & "genocide" in Xinjiang, and expose the true face of the #ETIM, a terrorist organization through and through.
French media reported on "paid labor" in prison & lauded the practice. Good. But when prisoners in France have the right to improve employment skills through paid work so they can pursue a happy life after release, why can't the innocent ethnic minorities in #Xinjiang ...
The vicious accusations the US flings at Xinjiang reflect its past crimes. Just look at this Washington Post article which exposed how the US government persecuted Native Americans with lies, smallpox, etc. It’s time for US politicians to wake up from their “Truman Show”.  
This only exposes its hypocrisy behind all the talk about rule of law & rules. It’s also evidence that the US strategic conspiracy is to destabilize #Xinjiang to contain China’s development, as Lawrence Wilkerson admitted.  
The few so-called “witnesses” are just trained “actors”. Not just #Xinjiang, people outside China, including in the US, have all exposed & refuted the lies in various ways.
#BCI Shanghai representative office stated: "Since 2012, the #Xinjiang project site has performed second-party credibility audits and third-party verifications over the years, and has never found a single case related to incidents of forced labor."
Some repeatedly allege that there is "#ForcedLabor" in #Xinjiang. But what's their evidence? Just the words of rumor-producers&spreaders.  
#China has invited #UNHRC to visit #Xinjiang. The two sides have been in communication over the trip. The purpose should be to promote exchange & cooperation, not to conduct so-called "investigation" based on presumption of guilt.  
Speaking of backstage manipulation, Wilkerson's speech at Ron Paul Institute exposed the shocking conspiracy of the US & West: to destabilize #Xinjiang & contain China's development. The cotton smears are just part of the bigger plot.  
Some accuse the Chinese government of fanning nationalism. Well, foreign brands refuse to use #Xinjiang cotton based on nothing but lies. This is more than enough to trigger indignation among the Chinese people.  
#BCI’s Shanghai office said it has not found a single case of "forced labor" in #Xinjiang. Then how was the conclusion of "forced labor" in Xinjiang reached? Show your evidence!  
In 2020, 69.83% of all cotton in #Xinjiang was harvested mechanically instead of manually. Cotton growers can order mechanical pickers through APP on their cellphone, a true symbol of the Internet+ era in cotton harvest.  
According to #US media, in 2016, a #Uyghur couple went to Italy with 3 children, leaving another 4 in #Xinjiang. If there's "forced sterilization" and "genocide" in Xinjiang as some in the west claim, how come this Uyghur couple have 7 children?
Some in the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU clearly don't want to acknowledge the real facts about #Xinjiang & don't care about the truth, but hold on to accusations based on lies & false information. They just do not want to see #China's success, development and better livelihood.
In 40 years, the #Uyghur population has grown from 5.5 million to 12.8 million. The fact that #Xinjiang residents of various ethnic groups enjoy stability, security, development and progress, makes it one of the most successful human rights stories.
#China deplores and rejects the unilateral sanctions by #EU citing so-called #HumanRights issues in #Xinjiang. This move is based on nothing but lies and disinformation, and will inevitably undermine China-EU relations.
"Forced labor" in Xinjiang is a flat-out lie. We have clarified the truth on multiple occasions. We hope relevant US organization and companies will tell right from wrong, refuse to buy the rumor and make right judgment based on their own interests.
China thanks the 64 countries who made overwhelming voice of justice at the 46th session of the UN Human Rights Council in support of China's position on Xinjiang-related matters.
There has never been any "genocide", "forced labor" or  "religious oppression" in Xinjiang. Such sensational rumors are fabricated by those ignorant and biased individuals, who simply want to seek political interests.  
We oppose baseless US rumors & smears against China. Xinjiang's Uyghur population doubled over the past 40 years while the population of native Indians in the US nosedived by 95% from 1492 to the early 1900s. It's NOT China that should be labeled "genocide".  
Claiming to conduct "academic research", Adrian Zenz has been cooking up various rumors about China, especially about the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. For him & the anti-China forces behind him, a day of reckoning will come.  
The door to Xinjiang is always open.  
Charges can easily be framed if you want to accuse others. The well-being of people in Xinjiang is the last thing certain Western countries care about. They simply want to interfere in China's internal affairs & disrupt its development under the cover of human rights.
We have used every possible occasion to debunk rumors flying around on Xinjiang. The so-called allegation of "genocide" and "forced labor" can never stand the test of facts.  
Allegations of "genocide" and "forced labor" in Xinjiang are lies of the century. Xinjiang's Uyghur population more than doubled in the past 40 years. Have you ever seen this kind of genocide?  
Don't fall for lies on Xinjiang.  
We strongly condemn the passing of the Xinjiang-related motion by Canada's House of Commons.  
Allegations of "genocide" in Xinjiang are LIES of the CENTURY. But genocide did take place in Canada, the US&Australia. In the 1870s, the Canadian government included assimilation of indigenous people in its official agenda&openly advocated “the killing of the Indian bloodline”.  
To get well-informed about Xinjiang, read this fact check:  
Here are some familiar names behind lies about Xinjiang.  
There is no genocide in Xinjiang. We hope the Biden administration will see the stability & development in Xinjiang and handle the issue in a fact-based and responsible manner. We oppose any interference in China's internal affairs.  
#Pompeo's lies are an affront to the 1.4 billion Chinese people including 25 million #Xinjiang residents & to the intelligence of the American people and the international community. He has betrayed & challenged the basic moral standard & human conscience.
The life expectancy of #Xinjiang residents grew from 30 to 72 over the past 60 years or so. The Uyghur population increased by 25.04% from 2010-2018, much higher than the 2% growth rate of the Han population.
In 2019, #Xinjiang received 200+ million domestic & foreign travelers. They saw with their own eyes how beautiful Xinjiang is & how people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang enjoy unity, harmony & happiness.
"China committing genocide & crimes against humanity in #Xinjiang" only exists in #Pompeo's ugly political conspiracies. It has never happened and will never happen in our country!  
@StateDept @SecPompeo @VOANews The U.S. & several other Western countries made "lies of the century" on China's Xinjiang region. Why on earth do some U.S. politicians think they can lecture China when so many American lives are lost from #COVID19 & people like George Floyd cannot even breathe?
.@IRF_Ambassador is a joke. He made so many slanders against China & created so many lies about #Xinjiang out of stubborn bias.  
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's 21st Press Conference on Xinjiang-related Issues was held On Dec. 21st in Beijing, briefing Chinese and foreign media on Xinjiang's situation and answering their questions. Click here to read the full text.  
The Uyghur population in China's Xinjiang grew 25% from 2010 to 2018 while Canada's population increase was only 1.42% in 2019. A sharp contrast! Please at least do your homework before making ludicrous comments. @BobRae48  
From Oct 19 to 22, diplomatic envoys posted in China from 20 Arab states and the Arab League visited #Xinjiang. Seeing is believing. Facts speak louder than words. China welcomes friends from Muslim countries, including Arab states, and the wider world to Xinjiang for a visit.  
The demonstration effect of various measures taken by the governments to promote employment and increase income has encouraged the initiative of ethnic minorities in Southern Xinjiang to go out for employment.  
A research on the employment intentions of ethnic minorities in the four prefectures in Southern Xinjiang showed the urban&rural surplus labor force have a strong desire to go out for employment.  
An investigation report on the employment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang based on verified documents, data and facts was released recently by the Xinjiang Development Research Center .  
What right do US politicians have to deny Chinese people's right to pursue better lives through hard work? While talking about their care about Xinjiang ethnic minorities, they are going after companies in Xinjiang. The real agenda to contain China's development is laid bare.  
Xinjiang-related issues are never about human rights, ethnicity or religion, but combating violence, terrorism&secession. China is the last party to wear the pin of crimes against humanity. Seeing is believing. We always welcome objective&fair-minded foreigners to visit Xinjiang.  
China firmly opposes "Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act" passed by the US House. The so-called "forced labor" is made up with nothing but lies by the US side. They should read through the "Employment&Labor Rights in Xinjiang" white paper by the State Council Information Office.
The US side hyping up the so-called "forced labor" issue in Xinjiang is typical case of disinformation&fake news.  
Truth is, at the UNHRC session in July, 46 countries commended China's Xinjiang policy & counter-terrorism & de-radicalization outcomes.  
The @StateDept webpage on Xinjiang is full of lies & rumors & lack of the truth. The US only intends to contain China & destabilize Xinjiang under the pretext of human rights.
The #Xinjiang-related issues are about #counterterrorism and #antiseparatism. The US tries to strangle Chinese companies, undermine Xinjiang's stability and smear China's policies in the name of human rights. The hypocrisy and vicious intents are laid bare.  
There is one mosque for every 530 #Muslims in Xinjiang, a number higher than that in many Muslim countries. Is there any kind of "suppression of #religiousfreedom"?
Over the past 40 years, the #Uyghur population in #Xinjiang grew from 5.55 million to 12 million. From 2010 to 2018, the population of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang increased by 22%. Is there any kind of "forced sterilization"?
The #US is the top human rights abuser. Its ridiculous allegation on #humanrights issues in Xinjiang is the lie of the century.
Such a shoddy lie! They can freely insult their own intelligence. But don't smear China with such low tricks. In Xinjiang, Uyghur population more than doubled in 40 years with a mosque for every 530 Muslims. Unlike African Americans, Uyghurs in Xinjiang can breathe freely.  
1/2 In response to #US sanctions on government entity & officials in Xinjiang, China is imposing sanctions on #CECC, Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Brownback, Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz & Rep. Chris Smith.
We firmly reject US sanctions on Chinese officials. The wrong move is serious interference in China’s internal affairs and detrimental to China-US relations. China decides to impose reciprocal measures on US institutions & individuals with egregious behaviors on Xinjiang.  
Pompeo and other politicians spread absurd stories & fake news, make groundless accusations against China's Xinjiang policies and interfere in China's internal affairs. The so-called issue of "forced labor" is pure fabrication and is thus deplored and firmly opposed by China.  
At the Human Rights Council, an overwhelming majority of 46 countries reaffirmed their support for China's Xinjiang policy in a joint statement. The attempt of few Western countries to smear China failed once again.  
1/3 Mr. Pompeo's statement on Xinjiang is again nonsense. The legitimate rights & interests of Chinese people of all ethnic minorities are fully protected. The population policy is preferential to ethnic groups. Xinjiang Uyghur population increased 2.1 times over 4 decades.  
The Uighur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 is an example of the US double standards on counter-terrorism. Check the latest documentary on counter-terrorism in Xinjiang.  
Xinjiang affairs are China’s internal affairs that allow no foreign interference. We urge the US to   stop using the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 to harm China’s interests. Otherwise, China will resolutely fight back, and the US will bear all the consequences.  
China firmly rejects 2019 Report on International Religious Freedom. The Chinese government protects citizens’ freedom of religious belief. The US has long-standing systematic racism. The number of mosques in the US nationwide is less than a tenth of that in Xinjiang.

UN officials and foreign envoys who have visited Xinjiang since 2018.  
▶Fifth, double standard.  The report treats #China as the subject of all evil, including its effective counter-terrorism efforts in #Xinjiang, but dismisses the human costs of US-led Global War On Terror.
▶Second, suspicious timing.  The report may have been published to back up Pompeo's genocide determination in #Xinjiang. No evidence accompanied it.
Take a look at this TFF analysis & find out why the report alleging genocide in #Xinjiang by Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy is problematic.   
@TheUNTimes #China has invited #UNHRC to visit #Xinjiang. The two sides have been in communication over the trip. The purpose should be to promote exchange & cooperation, not to conduct so-called "investigation" based on presumption of guilt. There should be no political manipulation!
In 40 years, the #Uyghur population has grown from 5.5 million to 12.8 million. The fact that #Xinjiang residents of various ethnic groups enjoy stability, security, development and progress, makes it one of the most successful human rights stories.
Fact Check: Lies on Xinjiang -     
On January 27, 2021, the Information Office of the People’s Government of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on Xinjiang-related issues.  
@SecPompeo @USUN Xinjiang Uyghurs live peaceful and happy lives. If this politician has a little conscience left in him, he should listen to Americans who cannot breathe and do something to protect the American people against COVID-19.
@SecPompeo @USUN Xinjiang Uyghurs live peaceful and happy lives. If this politician has a little conscience left in him, he should listen to Americans who cannot breathe and do something to protect the American people against COVID-19.
@StateDept @USUN People in Xinjiang are living happy lives!  Stop turning a blind eye to US people who are suffering & getting infected in large numbers every day!  Mind your own business. Save your own people. Lying and cheating won't make you great again!
@StateDept @USUN Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang are equal members of Chinese nation. They equally exercise rights and benefit from China’s development. They are marching into a moderately prosperous society in all respects. Respect facts and stop lying and cheating.
@StateDept @USUN People in Xinjiang are living happy lives!   Mind your own business. Save your own people who are suffering & dying in large numbers every day!   Lying and cheating won't make you great again!
@ECA_AS @USUN Rights of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are well protected. Your people are dying from COVID-19 with highest record. Your people can’t breathe and you don't care. Stand with your own people and keep your hands off Xinjiang.
@StateDept @USUN Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang are equal members of Chinese nation. They equally exercise rights and benefit from China’s development. They are marching into a moderately prosperous society in all respects. Respect facts and stop lying and cheating.
@USAmbUN No one knows Xinjiang better than the Chinese people, especially Xinjiang Uyghurs and they have the final say. Counter-terrorism measures protect all people in Xinjiang. The US should respect facts and stop interfering in China’s internal affairs.
Uygur population in Xinjiang rises 25 pct over 8 years, Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday.  
@StateDept @USAmbUN In Xinjiang, religious activities are widely practiced in 24,400 mosques, Uyghur language is widely used and Mandarin is expected to be learned. With over 140,000 daily new COVID-19 cases, you should take care of your own people instead of lying and finger pointing at others.
@StateDept @USAmbUN From 2010 to 2018, the Uyghur population in Xinjiang grew from 10.17 mil to 12.71 mil, an increase of more than 25%. Where is your conscience when telling such a big lie?  There are 24,400 mosques in Xinjiang, 10 times more than in US. What religious oppression can this be?  
The attempt to smear China’s human rights record at #UNGA #ThirdCommittee completely failed. Three more countries joined the joint statements on Xinjiang & Hong Kong. So far, more than 7⃣0⃣countries made statements supporting China at #3C.
@SecPompeo @USAmbUN US accusations on Xinjiang are nothing but lies & slanders   All ethnic minority people have the freedom to choose their occupations and there’s no forced labor at all   Since 2018, 150,000+ rural workers in Xinjiang have got out of poverty, making 45,000 yuan a year on average

@StateDept @USUN ◆Xinjiang issues are not about human rights, but about fighting violence, terrorism and separatism. US accusations on Xinjiang are full of lies. ◆It's ridiculous for the US, whose own people cannot breathe, to interfere in others' internal affairs in the name of "human rights".  
@USAmbUN US accusation is baseless & shameless. The situation in Xinjiang isn't about religion or human rights. The preventive counter-terrorism measures have yielded good results. The US should not use human rights to interfere in China's internal affairs. Let your people breathe first.
@statedeptspox @USUN @StateDept @USTreasury US accusations on Xinjiang are pure lies. China's internal affairs brook no foreign interference.  In response to US wrong moves, China has imposed corresponding sanctions against relevant US agencies and individuals.  We urge the US to immediately revoke wrong decisions.
@StateDept @USAmbUN Right of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to use their own languages & freedom of religious belief are fully protected by law. Stop sowing discord between different ethnic groups in China. Blaming others CAN'T cover up your own problems.
@StateDept @USUN Right of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang to use their own languages & freedom of religious belief are fully protected by law. Stop sowing discord between different ethnic groups in China. Blaming others CAN'T cover up your own problems.
@statedeptspox @USUN Any foreign interference in Xinjiang affairs should be held accountable.  It is the racial discrimination in the US that calls for an urgent solution.  China will take the reciprocal measures against relevant US agencies and individuals.
@statedeptspox @USUN The Uyghur people & other ethnic minorities in China enjoy a preferential population policy  Uyghur population in Xinjiang increased from 5.55 mln to 11.68 mln from 1978 to 2018  In contrast, Native American population plunged from 5 mln in 1492 to 0.25 mln in early 20th century
Traditional roast chicken in Hetian, #Xinjiang. What an interesting cooking method!  
Bumper #harvest in Turpan, #Xinjiang. Beautiful scenery with the most delicious green melons.  
For #Xinjiang, the prosperity and freedom enjoyed by her people will never be stained by such bluffing.
The pseudo-court is a puppet show - just a clown on a lonely string, manipulated by the evil hands in darkness, wearing an old-fashioned powdered wig, faking evidences, fabricating stories, and badmouthing about #China's #Xinjiang policies.
Some Western media focus so much on #fakenews about #Xinjiang, yet keep silent about the real #Genocide in Canada. Politics shouldn't override #humanrights.
In order to obtain“political asylum”, Kalibinur Sidike fabricated her identity as a “teacher from concentration camps” and joined anti-China forces to spread slanders against Xinjiang. She has never worked in any vocational education & training center.  
Sayragul Sauytbay never worked in any vocational education & training center, and had never been detained before she illegally fled China. She is suspected of committing loan fraud. She fabricated a large number of lies to defame Xinjiang.  
#Xinjiang: What a wonderful land!  
American politicians have been trying to pass the country's evil deeds on to others, by making up stories of "forced labor" in Xinjiang and other parts of the world. US hypocrisy is stunning.
Using the word “tribunal” as a cover, it resorts to grandstanding to attack Xinjiang & meddle in China’s domestic affairs  
It was patched together by the notorious anti-China separatist "World Uyghur Congress" in collusion with anti-China forces. Its speciality is producing &promoting lies to smear Xinjiang & meddle in China’s internal affairs with the end goal of splitting Xinjiang to contain China.
The smear campaign against #Xinjiang is based on nothing but lies.  
Given that BBC went so low with a royal celebrity, just imagine how ugly & hypocritical its geopolitical & ideological coverage is. It fabricated & spread so much disinformation on #China’s #Xinjiang.
From May 13 to 17, a 23-member delegation of ambassadors&senior diplomats from Latin American and Caribbean countries visited Urumqi, Turpan&Hotan in Xinjiang. Seeing the region as it is, the delegation expressed full support to Xinjiang's anti-terrorism&deradicalization efforts.

We find "The #Xinjiang Genocide Allegations Are Unjustified" carried by the #US-based media organization Project Syndicate objective and informative. We applaud its just voice on Xinjiang related issues.  
A SCMP article points out how the West intentionally negated China's counter-terrorism achievements and accused China of "genocide" in Xinjiang.  
The latest documentary on Xinjiang shows a real Xinjiang through a collection of individual stories, which is different from what is told by the US and Western media. Have a look.  
The opinion is from a series on Xinjiang published by the Australian Alert Service, a publication of the Australian Citizens Party. Have a look.
Some Western countries, including the US, have supported separatist&terrorist activities in China's Xinjiang for geopolitical purposes.  
A company in #Xinjiang filed a lawsuit against #AdrianZenz. It reflects a stronger rule-of-law awareness among the #Chinese citizens, who use the law to safeguard their rights and interests. It's great to see that happen.  
The #US keeps maligning Xinjiang and weaving outrageous lies about #China. Show your evidence and speak with facts!
NED is funded by and serves as an intermediary for the #US government and congress. It doesn't stop at fomenting unrest in #Xinjiang, but handles dirty deeds all around the globe, including in #HongKong.
#NED also disclosed on its website that it has funded the World Uyghur Congress from East Turkestan. Who will call Xinjiang East Turkestan?  
The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) said on Twitter that they have funded separatist forces in #Xinjiang since 2004. Have a look at the self-styled flag of East Turkestan.  
If the US is bent on repeating lies for 1,000 times, we will repeat truth 10,000 times. Whether the US believes it or not, facts and truth about Xinjiang will stay unshakable like mountain and clear like lake. Lies on Xinjiang will collapse and attempt to contain China will fail.
Third, the US wants to cover up its own poor record on the treatment of Muslims. Why do they “care about” Muslims in Xinjiang only? Because they have inflicted much suffering on Muslims around the world and are just trying to divert the Muslim community’s anger.
Second, the US wants to drive a wedge between China and Muslim countries. 64 countries, including Muslim countries, support China on Xinjiang-related issues at 46th session of UN Human Rights Council. None of the Muslim countries buys US’ vicious conspiracy to sow discord.
Why has the US kept repeating the lie of genocide in Xinjiang? First, they want to contain China by disrupting Xinjiang. They are trying to smear the white, innocent cotton. The accusations of “genocide” & “forced labor” should better be left to the US itself.
Please watch the 4th and latest #CGTN documentary on fighting terrorism in #Xinjiang. Facts abound to dispel the fallacies of the so-called "excessive counter-terrorism" & "genocide" in Xinjiang, and expose the true face of the #ETIM, a terrorist organization through and through.
How do some western media fabricate fake news about #Xinjiang?  
Shocking conspiracy of the U.S. & West: destabilize #Xinjiang & contain China's development. The cotton smears are just part of the bigger plot.  
It is a historical fact that the #UnitedStates forced black slaves to collect cotton. Who on earth engaged in forced labor? Don't scapegoat and smear #Xinjiang! There is absolutely no #forcedlabor in Xinjiang!
#Genocide? What genocide? Let's have a look what the #US was planning to do in #Xinjiang in #China.  
#Xinjiang in an art piece of a popular young illustrator in #China.  
Mijit Timit, a cotton farmer in #Xinjiang, dismissed forced labor allegations with his own experience.  
The #US, #EU, #UK and #Canada made "lies of the century" on China's #Xinjiang. They do not have qualifications to lecture on #China when so many lives are lost from #COVID19 & people like #GeorgeFloyd cannot even breathe.
Let us visit #Xinjiang to enjoy its peaceful life, hospitable people, tranquil mountains and beautiful lakes!  
The so-called "the judicial archives of Uygurs" claimed that the relatives of some overseas Uygurs have been detained or persecuted in #Xinjiang. However, the real situation of most of these people is completely opposite to what has been published in the "archives".  
Allegations of "genocide" and "forced labor" in #Xinjiang are lies of the century. Xinjiang's Uyghur population more than doubled in the past 40 years. Have you ever seen this kind of genocide?   
In #Xinjiang China, a gas station attendant is doing her best to serve her hometown and pursue a better life.  
When people are healthier, they are less likely to fall back into poverty. In #Xinjiang, standardization for clinics in townships & villages reached 100%, 99.7% residents were covered by the basic medical insurance, and all the residents have access to free physical checkups.  
Listen to what local people in #Xinjiang say about the "forced labor". Hotan resident: "I have 5 greeehouses and no one forces me work in greenhouses."  
The Xinjiang-related measures announced by the UK & Canada are based on nothing but lies & disinformation. Their erroneous decisions must be withdrawn. There are NO “camps”, NO “1 million Uyghurs detained” & NO “forced labor” in Xinjiang.  
The highest human right is the right to life and health. The U.S. government should do some soul-searching, stop spreading political virus and interfering in China’s internal affairs under the pretext of Xinjiang, and focus on resolving domestic problems.
The disinformation on Xinjiang fabricated by some American politicians is the biggest “lie of the century”. Xinjiang enjoys social stability, economic growth, ethnic solidarity, and people of all ethnic groups including Uyghurs are living a peaceful and happy life.  
Zafaruddin Mahmood visited #Xinjiang multiple times. He suggested, be "realistic" and "look at Xinjiang with one's own eyes and make a true assessment." How does he describe Xinjiang? Take a look:  
Welcome to Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, China.  
China decided to impose reciprocal sanction measures on US institutions & individuals with egregious behaviors on Xinjiang.   
Pompeo has been spreading many lies on Xinjiang. The so-called issue of "forced labor" is pure fabrication.  
Pompeo's statement on Xinjiang is nonsense.   
Vicissitudes and transformations. #Xinjiang, now China's inland area, was an ocean hundreds of millions of years ago. The Gobi dessert once swept with winds and sand is now turned green. This can also be found in the Loess Plateau.  
Built in 1987, #Urumqi, the Yanghang Mosque with its distinctive green-topped minarets & exquisitely carved pillars is now the venue for praying and worship by not only local Muslims in #Xinjiang but also by those overseas.

This #Canadian man found an interesting detail in his #Xinjiang tour.  
To discover the beauty of #Xinjiang, a themed film exhibition is on from May to July. Producers from a dozen countries will bring the audience Xinjiang's natural beauty, its authentic culture and people's life.  
How amazing is #Xinjiang? After sightseeing, two young visitors decided to stay and start up their B&B hotel in the ancient city of #Kashgar. Here's their venture stories.  
The #US hypocrisy and conspiracy of creating "#HumanRights issues" in #Xinjiang to mess up and contain #China have been seen through by more and more people, including our #African brothers.  
We welcome all unbiased people to visit #Xinjiang. That said, we firmly reject so-called investigation with presumption of guilt by citing lies and rumors.
This further laid bare their intention to make an issue out of the human rights situation in Xinjiang to disrupt and contain China, and to divert people’s attention from their own past and on-going human rights crimes and incompetency in domestic governance and #COVID19 response.
They would rather play along with the clumsy show of a handful of anti-China forces than face up to the development and progress in #Xinjiang.  
Those Western countries would rather believe the lies concocted by a few people than heed the voice of the 25 million people of all ethnic groups in #Xinjiang and the 1.4 billion Chinese.  
If they truly care about human rights, why didn’t they invite residents from #Xinjiang to attend the event? If they truly care about human rights, why don’t they reflect upon and redress serious racial discriminatory polices and behavior at home?  
The #US, #UK & #Germany ganged up with some NGOs to host a virtual conference on #Xinjiang’s human rights situation based on lies&political prejudice falsely in the name of UN.  
The #Xinjiang #Muslims are celebrating Eid al-Fitr (also called Ruzi Festival) today.  
They want to create "forced industrial decoupling" & "forced unemployment" in #Xinjiang to serve their malicious agenda to disrupt Xinjiang and contain #China.
Xinjiang cotton is pure white and solar energy is clean, but those in the #US who hype up the issue have a dark and sinister intention.   
5 clothing and textile firms from #Xinjiang participated in the #CICPE held in #Haikou, demonstrating the entire industry chain from raw materials to finished garments. 600+ cotton flowers were packed in an exquisite way and dispatched to visitors as souvenirs.  
A small bookstore blends in harmony into the nature in Kanas, #Xinjiang. With everything made from local materials, the place offers a "spiritual oasis" to every visitor.  
Some in the #US buy the "account" of the few false witnesses and experts, but refuse to listen to the voices far outnumbering those of false actors, and heed the call of 1.4 billion #Chinese people, including over 25 million people of all ethnic groups in #Xinjiang.
#Sweden-based TFF stressed "report" on genocide in #Xinjiang lacks credibility and the relevant #US think tank has obvious political aims.  
There are 55 ethnic minorities in #China, WHY does the US only "care about" Uyghurs in #Xinjiang? The #US is afraid of the truth and won't respect and listen to the voices of the 1.4 billion Chinese including the 2.5 million people in Xinjiang.  
Nonfactual allegations of "genocide" in #Xinjiang, #China are DISTAINFUL toward the victims of genocide and their families, and do a DISSERVICE to history, law and prudence in international relations.  : 
The video recorded how the #Uyghur boy from #Xinjiang was rescued by a love relay across 1400km. He is now in good condition.  
The last flight from #Khotan to #Urumchi, #Xinjiang, already taxing for take-off, returned to the terminal to pick up a 7yr-old boy with a seriously injured arm while a medical team 1400kms away was waiting to save him. It was a race against time and they won.  
Think tank's report exposes Western lies on #Xinjiang  
The #US goes all out to pressure #China, illegally detaining Chinese citizens, wantonly interfering in our internal affairs concerning #HongKong & #Xinjiang, and luring or coercing others into forming an anti-China clique. China is a victim of #coercivediplomacy.
▶Fifth, double standard.  The report treats #China as the subject of all evil, including its effective counter-terrorism efforts in #Xinjiang, but dismisses the human costs of US-led Global War On Terror.
▶Second, suspicious timing.  The report may have been published to back up Pompeo's genocide determination in #Xinjiang. No evidence accompanied it.
Take a look at this TFF analysis & find out why the report alleging genocide in #Xinjiang by Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy is problematic.

What the #US gov has been doing to #Xinjiang actually constitutes violations of human rights, including rights to development&work of people in Xinjiang particularly  the #Uyghurs. This is another form of racial discrimination.
Some accuse #Xinjiang of "forced labour" as many #Uyghurs work in low-skilled, labour-intensive sectors like clothing&cars. But if Uyghurs learning  Mandarin #Chinese could cause "genocide", how do they get knowledge&skills required by high-tech sector?

#Xinjiang: what the West doesn't tell you about China's war on terror  
The documentary tells the story about dozens of ordinary residents in the region. Their gender, ethnicity, age and hometown are not the same, but they share the same deep love for Xinjiang, the land they all call home.
"Beyond the Mountains: Life in Xinjiang" not only shows the striking beauty of Xinjiang's culture and natural landscape, but also profiles a region different from how it appears through Western media lenses.  
#NED twittered that they have funded separatist forces in #Xinjiang since 2004.  All these reveal the truth about Xinjiang and the untold evilness of the #US to make use of Xinjiang people to contain #China.  
Sibel Edmonds, a former #FBI translator, said that "We want to...play the minority without land (in #Xinjiang)...the #Chinese are gunning them down and torturing them...we put a military base there"; "We never cared about people...  
▪If the US is bent on repeating lies 1,000 times, we will reiterate the truth 10,000 times. Facts and truth about #Xinjiang stay unshakable like the mountain of Tianshan and clear like the lake of Tianchi. Prosperity, stability and ethnic harmony in Xinjiang are the best answer.
▪Since 2001, #US has launched military operations in around 80 countries in the name of fighting terrorism, leading to 800,000 deaths. Why does the US “worry itself sick” over Muslims in #Xinjiang only?
▪The US has been repeating lies of “genocide” in Xinjiang. It only reveals its three-fold conspiracy: contain China & hold back China’s development by disrupting #Xinjiang; sow discord between China & Muslim countries; cover up its deplorable record on the treatment of Muslims.
In 2019,  200mil home&overseas tourists visited #Xinjiang. In 2020, the number was 158mil despite the #COVID19 pandemic, 4 times the population of Canada. China, including Xinjiang, is now the safest place in the world.
A former #FBI staff exposed as early as in 2015 how the #US planned to use #Xinjiang against #China.  
This report, as early as February, disclosed how those Hitlerian “big lies”on #Xinjiang was made.   
For more truths about the so-called “witnesses” and their “testimonies” about #Xinjiang, check out the following links:  
Tursunay Ziawudun told her "experiences" to BBC, claiming that women suffered from "systemic rape" and "forced sterilisation" in #Xinjiang "concentration camps". Watch this video to check out the reality.  
See how senior CIA officer Graham Fuller wrote about the potential to spark the radicalisation of Uyghur separatists in #Xinjiang "to counter China's influence in Central Asia".  
Why #Xinjiang got so hot? Because some  are playing the "Uyghur card" to put pressure on China. And CIA is definitely the 1st in the line.  
This young man is telling us how some fabricate stories to smear #Xinjiang.  
Liu Xin, the well-known CGTN anchor, shares the story of her trip to #Xinjiang.
But mainstream #US media easily excited about #HumanRights issues showed collective silence over this. If the letter were addressed to #China instead of the US government, if it were about #Xinjiang instead of #Guam, what would have happened?
Thank you for telling the world a true #Xinjiang .
Thank you for telling the world a true #Xinjiang .
A video of nine years ago.  Migrant workers from #Henan Province went to #Xinjiang for their annual job- cotton picking.  It brought them good income and cross-region friendship.  
A glimpse into the lives of Uygur youths in Kashgar, #Xinjiang.   
Seeing is believing. Vladimir Norov, the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) shared his thoughts and experiences of his recent trip to China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in an interview with CGTN anchor Liu Xin.  
Seeing is believing. #ChinaCottonAssociation welcomes overseas industry organizations, brands and third-party institutes to visit #Xinjiang for field studies.  
French media reported on "paid labor" in prison & lauded the practice. Good. But when prisoners in France have the right to improve employment skills through paid work so they can pursue a happy life after release, why can’t the innocent ethnic minorities in #Xinjiang ...
If the prisoners in #France have the right to improve employment skills through paid work so that they could pursue a happy life after release, why can't the innocent ethnic minorities in #Xinjiang have the right to choose a profession out of their own free will,...  
The vicious accusations the US flings at #Xinjiang reflect its past crimes. Just look at this Washington Post article which exposed how the US government persecuted Native Americans with lies, smallpox, etc. It’s time for US politicians to wake up from their “Truman Show”.  
It’s also evidence that the US strategic conspiracy is to destabilize #Xinjiang to contain China’s development, as Lawrence Wilkerson admitted.  
The few so-called “witnesses” are just trained “actors”. Not just #Xinjiang, people outside China, including in the US, have all exposed & refuted the lies in various ways.
#BCI Shanghai representative office stated: "Since 2012, the #Xinjiang project site has performed second-party credibility audits and third-party verifications over the years, and has never found a single case related to incidents of forced labor."
Some repeatedly allege that there is "#ForcedLabor" in #Xinjiang. But what's their evidence? Just the words of rumor-producers&spreaders.  
Laughter, smiling faces and hospitality in #Xinjiang debunk all the lies and rumors.
Yet they seem to have a particular interest in the #Uyghur people in #Xinjiang (let's not forget there are 56 ethnic groups in #China).
Mind your own business! HANDS OFF #XINJIANG!
#Xinjiang, about 3 times as large as #France, 5 times #Italy, 6 #NewZealand or 7 #UK, is amazingly beautiful throughout the year. Just share some breathtaking pictures. Can't wait to go there.  
A bird view of cotton picking in #Xinjiang. So many people show their appreciation in the comments.   
Listen to a #Canadian's perspective of the truth of "#Genocide" in #Xinjiang.  
Listen to the facts about #Uyghurs in #Xinjiang.  
Take a close look at cotton picking in #Xinjiang. Local agriculture department: In 2020, 69.83% of Xinjiang cotton was harvested by machines. The number was up to 95% in northern Xinjiang. The mechanization in southern Xinjiang has increased steadily. Forced labor?  
#Mississippi in 1908 🆚 #Xinjiang in 2015  A shotgun and several hounds 🆚 smiles and harvests. Forced labor?  
A photo exhibition themed on #Xinjiang is opened in #Beijing, showing the beauty of nature, local happy life, rich ethnic culture, poverty alleviation efforts and better development in the region.  
According to #US media, in 2016, a #Uyghur couple went to #Italy with 3 children, leaving another 4 in #Xinjiang. If there's "forced sterilization" and "genocide" in Xinjiang as some in the west claim, how come this Uyghur couple have 7 children?
Some in the #US, #UK, #Canada and #EU clearly don't want to acknowledge the real facts about #Xinjiang & don't care about the truth, but hold on to accusations based on lies & false information. They just do not want to see #China's success, development and better livelihood.
In 40 years, the #Uyghur population has grown from 5.5 million to 12.8 million. The fact that #Xinjiang residents of various ethnic groups enjoy stability, security, development and progress, makes it one of the most successful human rights stories.
There has been no such thing as "genocide", "forced labor" or "religious oppression" in #Xinjiang. These sensational accusations are the results of ignorance & bias. They are ill-intentioned political hype-up that totally run counter to facts.
On behalf of 64 countries, #Cuba made a joint statement on #Xinjiang at the 46th #UNHRC session to support #China. Many other countries also spoken out at the Council to support China's legitimate stance.
#Xinjiang's reality features dynamism and diversity, rather than depression and desperation in some #Western media reports.  
@StateDeptSpox Ned Price claimed "genocide has taken place in #Xinjiang". Has he looked up the word "genocide" in the dictionary? Does he know what the word exactly means? Has he ever been to #China?  
#AdrianZenz has been fabricating rumors and lies on #Xinjiang. His lies about forced labor have caused injury to reputation and huge economic loss of these farmers and companies.
Some cotton farmers and processing companies in #Xinjiang have filed a civil lawsuit against #AdrianZenz, seeking for a formal apology, rehabilitation of reputation and compensation.  
This only shows that they do not care about the truth. They are only interested in political maneuvering, and creating the so-called #Xinjiang issue to undermine security and stability in Xinjiang and hold back #China's development.
They chose to dance with the few anti-China elements in their clumsy dramas, instead of acknowledging the progress in #Xinjiang.
Some #western politicians chose to believe in the lies made up by a few, instead of listening to the voice of 25 million #Xinjiang residents of various ethnic groups.
The claim that there is genocide in #Xinjiang couldn't be more preposterous. It is just a rumor fabricated with ulterior motives, and a lie through and through.
Why have they delayed visit to #Xinjiang time and again under various pretexts? Because they are afraid to see the real Xinjiang, which is totally different from what they imagined.
#China welcomes people from all over the world to visit #Xinjiang, including the #UN High Commissioner for #HumanRights and #European diplomats in China. The door to Xinjiang is always open.
See how the "spin doctors" in western media like #BBC made and spread deliberate misrepresentation on #China, with #Xinjiang as an example, with the words from those liars like Adrian Zenz. It's just smear campaign.  
The #LanternFestival is celebrated all over #China today, which concludes the #ChineseNewYear holiday.   Just share a few snapshots in #Xinjiang.  
Allegations of "genocide" and "forced labor" in #Xinjiang are lies of the century. Xinjiang's Uyghur population more than doubled in the past 40 years. Have you ever seen this kind of genocide?   
These "witnesses" have raked their brains for lies and acted as tools to serve certain countries' motives to hurt #Xinjiang's security&stability and contain #China's development. They  will never succeed.  
It's not that certain countries are incapable of making rational&facts-based judgement. Facts&truth about the real situation in #Xinjiang are there for all to see. But more often than not, they choose not to. They just cherry pick&twist facts to support what they want to believe.  
Some countries, citing "testimonies" of a handful of "witnesses", conclude that #Xinjiang has gravely violated #humanrights. The thing is that Xinjiang has 25,000,000 people! Lies of these few "witnesses" can not & should not override voices of the 25 million people in Xinjiang.
We welcome the High Commissioner for #HumanRights to visit #Xinjiang. #China already extended invitation to the High Commissioner and both sides have been in communication on that.
At the high-level segment of the 46th session of the @UN_HRC, State Councilor Wang Yi reiterated that the door to #Xinjiang is always open.
Anyone that has been to #Xinjiang would agree that what they saw and experienced there is entirely different from some Western media reports.
Seeing is believing.  Foreign friends are welcome to visit #Xinjiang. Anybody with an objective and just view can see its economic & social development.  
Moments captured from daily life in #Xinjiang.  
So ironic. These men have never been to #Xinjiang. While the so-called Xinjiang "genocide" only exists in their imagination, genocide did actually take place in their own country during the 1870s.
Astonished that Canada's parliament passed motion accusing #China of "genocide" in #Xinjiang. Even the #US media has revealed that the genocide charges are based on data abuse, sheer fabrication & distortion.  
We urge the #US to stop smearing the CPC&China's  political system, stop conniving at or supporting the erroneous words&actions of separatist forces for "Taiwan independence", and stop undermining China's sovereignty&security on internal affairs concerning #HK, #Xinjiang& #Tibet.
In the past 60 years and more, #Xinjiang's #GDP expanded by over 200 times, with per capita GDP growing by nearly 40 times. And its average life expectancy increased from 30 to 72.
Places inhabited by ethnic minorities, such as #Xinjiang and #Tibet, have stood out as shining examples of #China's #humanrights progress.
French journalist Maxime Vivas put down what he saw with his own eyes in #Xinjiang in the book titled "Uyghur--to put an end to fake news", in an effort to debunk "countless lies" by those who have never been there.   
The Taiwan question and issues relating to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, etc. are China's internal affairs and concern China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the US side should respect China's core interests and act prudently.
Fact Check: Lies on #Xinjiang-related issues versus the truth  
Too many lies about #Xinjiang, let's listen to what local people say about the "forced labor". ▶ 
#Xinjiang authorities, representatives of textile industries and religious circles, and some former trainees of vocational education and training centers, telling the truth about the region.  
On the 1st of February, the Press Conference by Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on Xinjiang-related issues was held in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing.
Field reports debunk lies and smears. The smiles of children in #Xinjiang speak volumes for their happy life.  
In Kekeya, a little-known place in Aksu, Northwest #Xinjiang, a "Green Great Wall" has been gradually erected thanks to the united efforts of local people of different ethnic groups, shoulder to shoulder, generation by generation. Now the desert became forest. A man-made miracle.  
#Pompeo's lies are an affront to the 1.4 billion Chinese people including 25 million #Xinjiang residents & to the intelligence of the American people and the international community. He has betrayed & challenged the basic moral standard & human conscience.
The life expectancy of #Xinjiang residents grew from 30 to 72 over the past 60 years or so. The Uyghur population increased by 25.04% from 2010-2018, much higher than the 2% growth rate of the Han population.
In 2019, #Xinjiang received 200+ million domestic & foreign travelers. They saw with their own eyes how beautiful Xinjiang is & how people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang enjoy unity, harmony & happiness.
"China committing genocide & crimes against humanity in #Xinjiang" only exists in #Pompeo's ugly political conspiracies. It has never happened and will never happen in our country!

2010-2018 data show: population of ethnic minorities in #Xinjiang increased by 22%; Uyghur population by 25%; Han population by 2%. Numbers will not lie. Has anyone seen any kind of #genocide like this?
Press Conference by Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region on Xinjiang-related Issues in Beijing         
Believe that the people of all ethnic minorities including Uyghur people in #Xinjiang are living a much better life than many ethnic minorities in the #US.
Between 2010 and 2018, the population of ethnic minorities in #Xinjiang increased by 22.14%, much higher than the 2% of ethnic Han population.
Vocational training served as  a turning point for many in #Xinjiang. As one former trainee said, do you need to be forced to make more money, learn more skills & change life with your own hands?
In the cotton-picking season, many migrant workers of the ethnic Han group in provinces like Henan, Sichuan & Gansu would go to #Xinjiang for good income. Uyghur people, too, are entitled to pursue a better life through work. Nobody can deprive them of this right.
Xinjiang officials, former trainees of vocational education & training centers & workers took questions from Chinese & foreign journalists, debunking claims of "forced labor",...  
For our foreign friends who truly care about #China and wish to know more about #Xinjiang, #Tibet and other parts of China, we are always ready to share with them the facts.
There has been too much false information about #Xinjiang and #Tibet, and the executive branch and #Congress have, on this basis, exercised long-arm jurisdiction on Chinese businesses and individuals.
Issues relating to #Taiwan, #HongKong, #Tibet and #Xinjiang are China's internal affairs and involve China's core interests. None of them shall be subject to foreign interference.
Ahmatjan, a young architect with a big dream, takes pride in designing and shaping the future of his hometown in #Xinjiang. Indeed, if the youth are strong, society will be strong.

The victory over #poverty in #Xinjiang cannot be secured without the local's hard work. The story of Ablikim's family is a case in point. This is how all the over 3 million poor people and 32 poor counties in Xinjiang lifted themselves out of poverty.
From 20102018, the #Uyghur population in Xinjiang grew from 10.17mln12.72mln, an increase of 2.55mln/25%, higher than that of the whole population in Xinjiang, which is 14%, and much higher than that of the Han population, which is 2%. How is it in any way "genocide"?
What will happen when drones meet cotton fields? Reports from #Xinjiang show us the answer.
Busy and delicious nightlife in Kashgar, #Xinjiang.
Over 15 million tourists visited #Xinjiang during the #NationalDay holiday this year and they were welcomed by happy smiles.  
The Uyghur population in Xinjiang over the past 40 years has more than doubled from 5.55 million to more than 12 million.  
#Xinjiang, a most popular destination, received over 15.35 mln visitors, 10% more than last year. Growth rate of tourist spending there ranks among the nation's top 3. Radiant smiling faces of various ethnic groups are the best illustration to Xinjiang's human rights conditions.  
And #Tibet, #Xinjiang Uyghur and Ningxia Hui autonomous regions saw the fastest growth in expenditures.
The so-called forced labor in #Xinjiang is sheer fabrication. People of all ethnic groups, whether in China or the #US, should enjoy equal right to employment. They should not be deprived of the rights to pursue better lives through legitimate work.

FM Payne & her American allies have been lashing out at China's #Xinjiang policy. But do they know the real situation in Xinjiang? Have they been there & seen with their own eyes everything they accuse China of?  
#US Department of State has become a Department of Disinformation. It has been fabricating rumors to discredit other countries, which will only result in eroding its own reputation and credibility. The Uighur population in #Xinjiang has doubled over the past 40 years.  
In 2019, over 200 million people from home & abroad visited #Xinjiang & over 40 million to #Tibet. Like other provinces in China, Xinjiang & Tibet are free, open & friendly to all tourists including foreign friends, except those with hidden agenda.  
The #US made up the lie of the century on #Xinjiang. As exposed by independent US news website, the rumor of "a million Uyghurs detained" was spread by NED-funded anti-China organization & Adrian Zenz, senior fellow with research group set up by US intelligence.
The US allegation on Xinjiang is among the Biggest Lies of the Century. Uyghurs' population in Xinjiang grew from 5.5 million to 11.7 million over 40 years. Unlike African Americans, they enjoy free breathing!  
Not the 1st time that #Pompeo cited false info and lied on Xinjiang. Adrian Zenz is a member of a far-right org set up by the US govt&a senior fellow of a "research group on Xinjiang's educational and training centers" set up&controlled by US intelligence agency.
Uyghur population in Xinjiang has grown from 5.55 million to 11.68 million in the past 40 years. If #Pompeo was telling the truth, how could such a substantial increase in population happen?  
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Xinjiang-related issues are China’s internal affairs. The East China Sea and the South China Sea concern China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. All these issues represent China’s fundamental interests and brook no interference.

The "Uygur genocide" narrative the #US and some of its allies have constructed for #Xinjiang boasts almost all elements of a typical Hollywood flick. What is the truth?   
Much like the post-9/11 war on terror – one in which the US, ironically, had considered China to be a partner – China has been waging its own counterterrorism offensive in Xinjiang. The extremists operate across China’s porous borders and train alongside the Taliban and IS.
What we do not read about in the West is that terrorism was spiraling out of control in Xinjiang and remains a serious threat today, the author said, adding that the organization often claimed responsibility was designated as a terrorist group by UNSC.

#HiddenConspiracy revealed: The US is using #Xinjiang #Uygurs to destabilize China. Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to former US Secretary of State, said the CIA wants to use Uyghurs to foment unrest and destabilize China. Do other countries still want to follow the US?  
Forced labor in picking cotton in #Xinjiang? It seems we are forcing machines to do the job. For example, in Shaya Country, more than 80% of its cotton is harvested by machines. #StopDisinformation  
Chinese Vice FM Qin Gang summoned EU ambassador to lodge a solemn protest against EU sanctions over #Xinjiang, pointing out that the EU sanctions were based on lies and misleading information and are inconsistent with facts, laws and justification.

The Chinese government, by offering training and employment opportunities, helps people in Xinjiang get out of poverty. The past 4 years have not seen a single terrorist attack in Xinjiang. It seems that not everyone wants to see a peaceful Xinjiang. China haters don’t.
No discrimination or suppression is allowed in #Xinjiang.  Issues facing Xinjiang are about fighting terrorism, extremism, and separatism, not human rights violations. A few years ago, Xinjiang was severely ravaged by terrorism and violence, causing huge casualties and losses.
Amb. Zhang Ming talked to @shada_islam @EPC on #Xinjiang:  I have noted media reports and I am deeply concerned about possible sanctions on China. We are against interference in others’ internal affairs, against sanctions, and against groundless accusations.
Cuba on March 12 made a joint statement on behalf of 64 countries at the 46th session of the UNHRC in support of China's position on #Xinjiang-related matters. The statement also urged the relevant parties to stop using such matters to interfere in China's internal affairs.

Le soi-disant "travail forcé" au Xinjiang est une farce pour calomnier la Chine.  
The allegation of genocide in #Xinjiang is the biggest lie in history.  
La « découverte principale » de Zenz est que « 80% des stérilets ajoutés nets en Chine sont placés au Xinjiang, bien que cette région ne représente que 1,8% de la population nationale ». Mais selon les chiffres officiels, le taux ne représente que  8,7% du total en Chine.
Selon  « The Grayzone », un site d'information indépendant américain ,l'accusation de l'administration américaine sur le « génocide des minorités ethniques du Xinjiang » repose sur un rapport de recherche plein de données manipulées et de fausses informations.

As State Councilor/FM Wang Yi said on Monday, the door to #Xinjiang is always open. People from many countries who have visited Xinjiang have learned the facts and the truth on the ground. China also welcomes the High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Xinjiang.
Wang Yi: The door to #Xinjiang is always open. People from many countries who have visited Xinjiang have learned the facts and the truth on the ground. China also welcomes the High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit Xinjiang.  
There has been no violent terrorist case for more than 4 years in a row in Xinjiang. The region now enjoys social stability and sound development. Between 2010 and 2018, the Uyghur population in Xinjiang increased by nearly 2.55 million, registering a growth rate of 25%.
#Xinjiang-related issues are in essence about countering violent terrorism & separatism. It has been earnestly implementing the UN Action Plan to Prevent Violent Extremism, drawing on similar practices of other countries & taking de-radicalization measures in accordance with law
FM Wang Yi: There has never been so-called "genocide", "forced labor" or "religious oppression" in #Xinjiang and such inflammatory accusations are fabricated out of ignorance and prejudice.

Wang also stated facts and China's stance on issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and human rights, reiterating China's opposition to foreign interference and the spread of lies and fake information. He hoped the EU would respect the truth and view the issues objectively.
Facts: From 2014 to 2019, the number of people employed in Xinjiang rose from 11.4 million to 13.3 million. From January to November 2020, 3.15 million jobless rural residents found employment.  
Contrary to the false and ridiculous "forced labor" claim, millions of #Xinjiang people have shaken off poverty and are enjoying happy lives. People in Aktash Town, Xinjiang's largest poverty relief resettlement site, embrace a new life after relocation.  
It's extremely ridiculous for the media and politicians to hype up the so-called "forced labor" issue in Xinjiang. It's nothing but pure slander.   
A remarkable journey! The 1st #ChinaEurope 🇨🇳🇪🇺 freight train 🚂 carrying #B2C cross-border e-commerce products departed from Shenzhen on Dec 5. It will pass the Alashankou Port in NW China's Xinjiang, and arrive in Budapest, Hungary after a 16-day journey  
Seeing is believing. China welcomes friends from Muslim countries, including Arab states, and the wider world to #Xinjiang  for a visit.
Does "forced Uygur labor" truly exist in China? Read the findings of a report by Xinjiang Development Research Center after visiting and talking to more than 800 company managers, employees, self-employed and ethnic minority employees.

Nearly 70 countries made statements at #ThirdCommittee #UNGA75 , supporting and echoing China's position, said @MFA_China @SpokespersonCHN. Once again, a few western countries failed in their attempt to smear China on issues related to #HongKong and #Xinjiang, she added.

Another #FakeNews on #Xinjiang
On so-called China's birth control on Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the fact is the Uyghur people and & ethnic minorities enjoy a preferential population policy. The Uyghur population in Xinjiang ⬆ from 5.55m to 11.68m from 1978-2018, accounting for 46.8% of the total population.

Truth can’t be distorted! Yalqun Rozi (editor of Xinjiang Education Publishing House) instilled separatist thoughts&incited ethnic hatred when compiling Uyghur teaching materials for primary&secondary schools. The textbooks full of separatism&terrorism were used for 13 years!
''Genocide'' in #Xinjiang is the lie of the century dispersed by a few #US politicians based on rumors &disinformation fabricated by so-called ''scholars'' like @adrianzenz, aimed at disrupting Xinjiang &containing #China. The practice of making &spreading lies is doomed to fail.

The "Uygur genocide" narrative the #US and some of its allies have constructed for #Xinjiang boasts almost all elements of a typical Hollywood flick. What is the truth?

Its a century lie, hyped up by fmr #SecPompeo, as @SecBlinken inherits the anti-China policy &keeps saying #China committed a ''genocide'' in #Xinjiang. In fact, #Washington tried to conceal its heinous crimes against #Muslims in US wars against #Afghanistan, #Iraq & #Syria etc.

There have been many attempts to fabricate &spread lies &disinformations about #cotton or so-called ''#ForcedLabor'' in #Xinjiang. This timeline, which starts from the public fury surrounding a statement by fashion retailer H&M, positions these fantasies with facts.  
#Xinjiang #Uyghur Autonomous Region is the largest #cotton producing area in #China, w/ an annual output of about 5 mln tons. Cotton has become one of the main source of #income for local #farmers, especially in the areas inhabited by ethnic groups in southern Xinjiang.  
A video of former #US Secretary of State Powell’s Office Director&former Army Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson recorded in August 2018 explains one of the 3 purposes of US troops stationed in #Afghanistan is to contain #China&the best way to destabilize China is to use #Xinjiang issue.  
The #XinjiangCotton is not picked by ''#forcedlabor'' as the rumor widely spread by the #US &the West. Instead the cotton is picked by ''forced mechanized laborer'' in #China's Xinjiang.

#Xinjiang-related issues are about lies&truth. It's nothing short of absurdity that #US based its sanctions against China on lies&rumors. If US truly cares for &safeguards ethnic minorities'rights as China does w/ Uyghur, US' racial discrimination would have been solved long ago.

Why is the #US obsessed with smearing #Xinjiang through gimmicks?  -to hinder #China's dvlpment under the guise of ''human rights''; -to discredit #CPC &China by hijacking int'l law.  A worth-reading article by @globaltimesnews.  
Facts & figures about #Xinjiang #Uygur Autonomous Region of #China:

#YangJieChi said the #US should strictly abide by the 1-China principle &3 Sino-US joint communiques. #HongKong, #Xinjiang & #Tibet-related affairs are all China's internal affairs &allow no interference from any external forces. Any attempt to slander &smear China won't succeed.
#Xinjiang is a wonderful place where 56 ethnic groups are tightly united as seeds within a pomegranate fruit as they work together for a better life.  
#WangWenbin: Some people seem to believe that whatever #BBC airs is true, while if something happens in #Xinjiang, it must inevitably be bad. This is blinding bias in its worst manifestation that runs counter to facts and truth.  
Facts check: Lies on #Xinjiang-related issues versus the truth.

#Xinjiang is a wonderful land. Today I'm glad to join my colleagues from Xinjiang to present this wonderful land online. For over 4 years, no single terrorist attack has happened there. Local economic &social development is thriving. This is a best rebuttal to lies about Xinjiang  
On #Xinjiang, I myself have been to Xinjiang more than once in recent years. I saw a very different picture from some fabrications on the media. Until very recently, the biggest threat to Xinjiang was terrorist attacks.
